### SENATE INQUIRY INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES

Submission by the RE100 Research Group from the Australian National University

## 27 July 2018

## Introduction

The RE100 research group investigates methods to decarbonise the Australian economy. After grid electricity, electrifying transport is the next most cost effective way to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate local pollution. Electric vehicles (EVs) have many benefits when compared with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. A detailed report discussing these has been included as an appendix to this submission, as has a report exploring the possible pathways for second-life batteries – namely reuse or recycling.

This technology transition is occurring – the question is whether Australians will experience the benefits or miss out on the economic and social benefits. This transition could increase the electricity consumption in the National Electricity Market by one third, and will require investment in infrastructure from many stakeholders.

### Terms of Reference that are addressed:

• A: The potential economic, environmental and social benefits of widespread electric vehicle

## uptake in Australia;

• B: Opportunities for electric vehicle manufacturing and electric vehicle supply and value chain

### services in Australia, and related economic benefits F: Any other related matters

## •

### Key Points and Recommendations

### Electrifying transport will mean:

### Improved air quality in population centres Lower noise pollution

## • • • Overall less energy being consumed for transport • Amelioration of national liquid fuel security problems •

Less variability in transport “fuel” costs, as prices will ideally be tied to local renewable electricity generation rather than international markets Lower total costs of ownership for individuals, business and the public sector as fleets are electrified Less waste from maintenance (for example, oil changes will no longer be required) Job changes, as fewer traditional mechanics are required, and more technicians needed who are trained to work with electric vehicles

### Electric VehiclesSubmission 108

• Apart from the initial production and sale of new electric vehicles, markets may exist for second- life batteries (which can be used within the electricity system for storage and grid ancillary services) or for the recycling of old batteries

## We recommend:

• That Federal, State and local government begin electrifying their fleets and studying the impact this has on electricity consumption, the required infrastructure for this change, and overall costs. Apart from passenger vehicles, this should include light commercial vehicles, buses and other heavier vehicles Fleet wide fuel efficiency standards should be implemented. These should be informed by those found in the European Union and the United States of America. This will help industry and the community to recognise the change that will occur to ensure effective planning to support a smooth transition.

The following reports were generated as part of the project Sustainable Mobility Solution for Canberra City, which was supported by Excellerate Australia (formerly AutoCRC), and spanned the period July 2016 to May 2017. Due to the speed of technology transition in this field, some of the information is now out- of-date.

## Executive Summary

• Electric vehicles have lower running costs than conventional internal combustion engines, and can be powered with renewable grid electricity. Solutions currently exist for electric buses, motorbikes, vans, and are being developed for electric semi-trailers and rubbish trucks. By converting the entire fleet to EVs, the entire road transport sector can be decarbonised.

• Electric vehicle batteries represent can either an opportunity or an expensive hurdle, depending upon the way in which they are used. If consumers fully recharge their car upon arrival at home each day, evening peak demand will increase and transmission networks will need to be extended. If, instead, smart charging is used, the efficiency of the current system can be increased, and grid extension may even be avoided.

• Electric vehicles can also provide a convenient power supply during natural disasters, or

### grid black outs, or simply for camping.

Internationally, many car manufacturers, research institutions and electricity utilities are testing the capabilities of electric vehicle charging schemes that support grid stability. In Australia, stationary energy storage has been treated in the same way, but EV charging has been told to consume “All you can eat” from AGL.

• This mindset needs to be changed to avoid an increase in peak demand, followed by the need to increase the capacity of the electricity network and a possible negative campaign against all electric vehicles.

### M005: Multiple Uses for Electric Car Batteries Given that electric vehicles (EVs) have lower running costs, many environmental benefits, and charging them at home can be more convenient than visiting a petrol station, many Australians will choose to purchase EVs rather than petrol or diesel cars in the coming decades. Rather than dependence upon imported oil that is refined overseas and petrol stations, Australia will be reliant upon our electricity grid for mobility.

Changes to the electricity grid over the past few decades, such as the increase in air conditioning, and more recently the installation of residential solar photovoltaic systems, has changed the daily demand load. This is especially true in summer, when long, hot days mean solar systems generate plenty of electricity during the middle of the day, but air conditioners are turned on during the afternoon and then evening, when the solar electricity can no longer be used to meet the peak load. This can be seen in the following figure. Although peak electricity demand has dropped during the middle of the day, the evening peak has increased by a small margin.

Figure 1: Changes in the demand curve due to increasing solar photovoltaic penetration [1]

There are challenges associated with charging electric vehicles. If these are not planned for, and for example, all commuters charge their cars upon returning home, the evening peak demand will continue to increase into the future. This would necessitate a costly expansion of infrastructure, and cause more increases to electricity prices. If these challenges are taken into account, and appropriate measures are put in place, electric vehicles have the potential to assist in providing a more stable grid, and also in increasing the efficiency of the grid.

This report assumes no change in the pattern of usage of vehicles. Advances in autonomous driving, and the opportunities that are available due to smart phone usage and the growing “services economy” could

pave the way for fleets of driverless taxis that remove the need for a proportion of the population. These changes are dependent upon technological progress, government policy, and consumer behaviour, and so lie outside the scope of this report.

Household consumers, private businesses, governments and the public service, retailers and generators will each have different uses for battery storage, and will utilise their vehicles in different ways.

### Vehicle to Grid and Vehicle to Home Vehicle to grid charging refers to a charging infrastructure that will return energy to the grid when needed. This term is sometimes used to refer to any system that provides support to the electricity grid, for example, stopping charging altogether to lower peak demand, but the definition used within this report will be a system that returns electricity to the grid from the vehicle battery.

This type of system is more complicated than a typical charging set up. Protection settings and hardware needs to prevent power from being fed back into a blacked-out grid, which could be fatal to emergency workers.

Batteries are specifically designed for their task. Vehicle batteries, such as those used in Tesla’s Model S, are not optimised for use as stationary storage systems. EV and stationary batteries for either home or grid purposes require different ratios for delivery of power and energy.

Drawing power from an electric vehicle battery to support the electricity grid increases the use of the battery. These systems degrade slowly with both usage and time, and so increasing their usage will decrease their lifetime.

Batteries are capable of reacting to a power event extremely quickly. This can provide a buffer period for a peaking plant, such as a pumped hydro system or a gas or coal plant, to come online. This type of plant is capable of producing energy for several hours. If batteries are used in this way – as a stop gap used to balance the grid while other generation is brought online, energy may only need to be drawn for up to one or two minutes. As will be discussed below, rather than utilities controlling charging, this part is being played by auto manufacturers. In this case, it is unlikely that very short term events can be provided for.

The hardware used to connect the car to the grid would need to pass sufficient safety standards. For example, during a blackout the car should not be capable of sending electricity into the network, as this could be fatal to emergency workers and electricity network service people. This connection would likely be more expensive than the systems currently available, which are more simple [2]. However, automatic disconnection technology is relatively straightforward, and is incorporated into every roof-mounted PV system (of which there are approximately 1.5 million in Australia) [3].

However, financial benefits may outweigh costs if the wholesale market can be accessed, and energy be sold back to the grid at times of peak demand, and depending upon the power that can be delivered to from the battery. This is not available on the National Electricity Market, and there is no sign it will be available for consumers into the near future. As these have been designed for use in a vehicle rather than for providing grid services, it is unlikely that the batteries will have been optimised for providing large amounts of power quickly. Only using the battery to take advantage of the few extremely high price events may not cause too much wear and tear. Taking the Tesla S as an example, which has a 60 kWh battery [4], and a price high of $14,000 per MWh three times a year, if the car were fully charged at the beginning of the event, and released all of its energy into the grid (and the price stayed high and stable

## 4

for the entire time it took to release this energy), the car could generate $2,520 for the owner. Given that the cost for a replacement battery was advertised as US$10,000 for a 60 kWh battery in 2012 [5], and assuming that this fast discharge was not particularly detrimental to a battery that has been designed for use in a vehicle, running three extra cycles to generate this amount of profit may be desirable. Of course, the car would need to be plugged in and completely charged during the price events, and to have sufficient time to recharge (at a low price) before the car was needed for travel.

As discussed, consumers are not able to access the wholesale market. In this case, the consumer can either buy off-peak electricity and sell during the peak period, or store solar energy and sell during the peak. The difference between peak and off-peak prices in NSW is less than 40 cents [6], and it is probably not worth setting up this sort of system. It is more likely that the retailer would take advantage of V2G charging, and thereby access a new profit stream. In this case, the consumer would need to be adequately recompensed for the use of their investment. Care would also need to be taken to ensure the car was sufficiently charged the next day. An app that had access to the estimated distance that the customer was likely to travel, and that would add a precautionary amount of charge in case of emergency, may come in handy.

A more likely scenario is discussed below, where the intensity of charging is limited, or stopped altogether, to manage demand peaks.

## Nissan has developed V2G alongside Vehicle to Home (V2H) charging. In this case, rather than provide electricity to the grid in return for a financial reward, consumers are able to power their house during a black out. This provides a much more immediate benefit to the consumer, and so the cost from the degradation of the battery may be more palatable. The original system was, however, advertised for everyday home use in 2012 [7]. Nissan launched this Leaf to Home system in Japan, [7] [8]. It was also capable of V2G charging during peak demand periods. The power outages that Japan had been experienced after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami were a factor in bringing this solution to market [9]. The 24 kWh battery can power a Japanese household for two days [8], whereas the average US or Australian house would require more energy (depending upon the time of year).

Information on the equipment needed to connect a Leaf to a home can be found on internet forums, and an owner in the US powered their homes with their car in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In 2012, when asked about Nissan owners voiding their warranty by using their car as a stationary energy source, a Nissan North America spokesperson commented: “if there is no outward evidence, I don’t know how they could be caught unless it combusted or something!” [9]. The Australian Nissan battery warranty is as follows: “Original equipment batteries as fitted to every new Nissan vehicle are fully covered for defective manufacture during the first 12 months with unlimited kilometres, and will be replaced free of charge should a defect occur in that time.” [10]. Given that typical lifetimes of many batteries are quoted as 10,000 cycles, degradation over one year may not be apparent unless the car were cycled multiple times each day. In any case, it is better practice to keep the EV topped up each day, so that the depth of discharge is low. This operation should lead to higher battery life [11].

In 2013, Nissan announced the installation of a power station for one road rest area in each of Japan’s 47 prefectures, to be used for normal activities, such as powering an information system for local residents and tourists, providing grid stability by discharging power when demand is high, and providing emergency power in the event of natural disasters [12].

Vehicle to building was tested in the Nissan Advanced Technology Centre in Japan in 2013, which used 6 Leafs to shave peak demand [13]. Nissan also tested this solution within dealerships in Japan in 2014, with the facilities sometimes powered from Leaf’s for three hours at a time [14]. Company cars, particularly for employees of retailers, automobile manufacturers and research institutions, could be the most likely candidates for V2G charging infrastructure. If the company is renting the cars for the employee, the battery degradation could be deemed either a research or business expense. As large electricity purchasers are also charged for their peak demand usage, decreasing this by cycling EV batteries may turn out to be much cheaper than paying the utility. Employees would also be assured of a parking space.

Nissan has installed 8 sets of V2G charging sites at their UK R &D centre, which are to be used by their employees. These stations can charge and discharge EVs [15]. The new French Nissan office will also host the installation of 100 V2G chargers, along with stationary energy storage from 64 second-life Leaf batteries. This was announced in March 2016 [16].

The company has also installed 10 V2G chargers at the Danish utility Frederiksberg Forsyning headquarters’. The automobile company has partnered with an integrated energy company called Enel to develop these chargers [16]. An Enel spokesperson has commented that they are “working hard to define a sustainable business model that allows all the parties to be profitable in their own domains”, to provide opportunities for arbitrage to consumers, and also a desire to be the “’AirBnb’ of EVs”. By the end of 2016, 440 kW will be available in Denmark, with each V2G charger capable of drawing and returning a load of 10 kW [17]. This is the first bidirectional charger to be tested and approved by the CHAdeMO Association. CHAdeMO stands for Charge de Move [7].

Nissan and Enel have also announced a V2G demonstration project in the UK in May 2016. This will include 100 EVs and electric vans, whose owners can sell electricity back to the National Grid [18].

The Chairman for Nissan in Europe, Paul Wilcox, has commented that “Not only will Nissan electric vehicle owners be able to play an active role in grid stability, but it will change how energy is supplied to the grid: once scaled up, the V2G technology can become a game-changer for owners of EVs in the UK as they become fully-fledged and active participants in the UK energy sector” [18].

## Tesla The Tesla 8 year battery warranty is voided if the vehicle is used as a stationary battery supply [19].

## Mitsubishi Both the Mitsubishi i-Miev and Outlander PHEV can be used for V2H in Japan [20].

### BMW and University of Delaware The BMW Mini-E electric car, which was released in 2008 [21], was produced with a bidirectional charger [22]. This has made is very useful for testing V2G functionality, for example within the University of Delaware and NRG V2G demonstration project. Here, fifteen Mini-E cars were leased for $3600 per year for two years, but if the cars were plugged in continuously when not being driven, participants could earn up to $1200 back each year, and major maintenance was provided [23] [24]. The project provided frequency ancillary services, and generated revenue [25]. The University of Delaware’s research has resulted in the development of V2G technology that is being used in the 10 V2G chargers at the Danish commercial site that was described in the Nissan section above [26].

## Honda has showcased the Power Exporter 9000, which is advertised for use with their Fuel Cell Vehicle to provide up to 9 kW of power for V2H purposes [27].

## Australia Western Power, the utility in WA, has an application form for Vehicle to Grid charging on their website, accessible here [28]: They describe their customer as: “You want to connect an electric vehicle to our network to send power to the grid or to control the charging of your vehicle's battery in response to changing grid conditions” [29]

The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) converted a 2006 model Prius so that the 4.1 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery could provide energy back to the grid through a PV inverter. This was the first V2G installation in Australia, and was sponsored by the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change [30]. The car was charged from one power plug, and provided electricity to the grid from a second [31]. This vehicle was to be trialled by the NSW Government, but information about the outcomes of the trial is not available on the Office of Environment and Heritage website.

### Emergency Back-up Power or Camping Power Supply An electric vehicle can be used as a climate controlled safe location during an emergency. If the EV is parked within a garage, there is no danger in having the vehicle operate overnight. The air conditioning can be used to keep people comfortable, and portable electronics can be charged. Tesla cars can even be purchased with a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, which is capable of removing pollen, bacteria and air pollution from the air entering the cabin. This is a medical-grade system, and Tesla advertises that the system can stand up to a bioweapon attack [32]. Once the air inside the car is filtered, the car begins to capture pollutants from the surrounding area [33]. The HEPA filter system costs $4,500 for Australian Tesla’s [34].

Bjørn Nyland, a Tesla Model X owner in Norway, provided information on the energy his car consumed while he and his wife camped overnight. Over seven hours, 46 km of range, or just over 9 kWh, was used to keep the cabin at 19 °C, while the ambient temperature was between 2 and 5 °C [35]. Bjørn has estimated that his Model X can provide air conditioning for 80 hours [36]. However, he does not place his car into Bio-Weapon Defence mode.

Other EVs can also be used to provide electricity, but other car manufacturers do not include HEPA filters. The size of the battery system will determine the length of time

### Demand-Responsive Charging A simple form in which car batteries can provide support to networks is by increasing or reducing demand on the grid through dynamic charging, where the charging intensity is dependent upon the condition of the grid. If there is a surplus of cheap electricity, EVs would charge their batteries. If it is a hot afternoon and air conditioning load has caused a peak demand event, as long as there was sufficient charge in the EV battery, the system would wait for a better charging time. This could mitigate problems with the transition from coal and other large, centralised plant to a more distributed system which has less inertia.

Two forms of charging are possible; those are controlled charging and smart charging. In the former, the charging is controlled externally – for example by the utility, or by a third party. In the latter, the software within the vehicle manages the charging [37]. to avoid inconvenience to the owner, a system to

## 7

ensure the car has sufficient charge for its next journey is needed. This could involve linking the owner’s calendar with software within the car (or the car’s profile in the controlled charging case), so that the next day’s trip time and distance are available. Personal privacy would need to be balanced with the availability of charge within the car.

Financial incentives can make demand-responsive charging more attractive. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that controlled charging could save $70 per year per car, with no inconvenience for drivers and no extra degradation for batteries [38].

This type of dynamic charging will not be possible at public chargers. Long distance charging stations designed for rest stops already require up to 30 minutes to return to a full battery – increasing the time needed for charging to provide grid support will be too inconvenient for consumers, particularly as demand for charging increases and lines of cars form. As these systems draw high loads from the grid, if the system isn’t designed for robustness, there is a chance that grid outages and other problems can occur. BMW has a charger that can draw 24 kW, and the Tesla superchargers pull 120 kW [39]. Higher socioeconomic suburbs may become even bigger hot spots for electricity use. The same is true for on-street and parking lot charging stations.

Some utilities have begun to investigate this, although more interest has been shown in stationary energy systems, such as the AGL virtual power plant planned for South Australia, which will consist of 1000 ESSs with 5 MW and 7 MWh of capacity. This $20 million project expected to “ease local network constraints, displace gas power and complement the Victorian interconnector, especially during times of peak demand” [40].

San Diego Gas and Electric have run a pilot project which groups EV and stationary batteries into five blocks and purchased power, or stopped charging, to take advantage of low prices. This also increased grid stability, as short-term imbalances of power could be addressed [41]. Although the project involved not charging cars as opposed to discharging them, it has been described as a V2G installation [42]. The trial ended in late 2015, and the utility now offer an EV time of use (TOU) package, with on- peak, off-peak and super off-peak and different rates for summer and winter use [43].

Figure 2: San Diego Gas and Electric summer and winter TOU charges for EVs [43]

Increases in penetration rates of photovoltaics in California mean that utilities have needed to quickly ramp up or decrease generation within the system [44]. Planned charging of EVs could be used to deal with this problem [17].

Figure 3:The demand changes on a typical Spring day on the Californian electricity system from 2012 to 2020 [44]

A Greentech Media report found that “assuming current charging behavior from the base-case scenario, without additional action taken by utilities, EVs could have reduced over-generation risks by 0.2% to 0.4% in 2015 and by 1.5% to 1.7% in 2020” [45]. Reducing the need to curtail renewables will also be possible.

## BMW is approaching the end of one trial, and is choosing participants for a second, aimed at providing a flexible load for grid operators Pacific Gas & Energy (PG & E). The initial trial selected 100 i3 BMW owners, and provided a financial incentive in return for some flexibility. Over June 2015 to October 2016, 192 demand events occurred, and more are expected up to the trial’s finish in December 2016, and during 94% of these events, BMW was able to reduce demand by 100 kW [46]. The second trial will run for two years, and BMW is looking to recruit more than 250 i3, i8 and iPerformance vehicles. In the case where participants need to charge their car immediately, they can circumvent the system [47].

Interestingly, rather than PG & E managing the charging delays directly, BMW has performed this function having received an internet request from the utility [17]. It is possible that BMW is investigating new profit streams.

This sort of program works well for vehicles plugged in at home or at work, but not for those at public stations.

A retailer in the US, Sonoma Clean Power, has introduced a scheme for consumers who are interested in low emissions intensity. Information on consumers charging patterns are collected into a cloud-based software, JuiceNet, and this information is used to predict usage, and also to increase the overall penetration of renewable energy [48].

The program rewards consumers with cash back in return for having charging disabled during high demand and cost periods, and increasing charging when there is high penetration of renewables in the electricity mix. At these times, the low running cost for renewables frequently depresses the wholesale market price (negative prices have been seen grids such as Texas and South Australia), and so the retailer is passing on these beneficial prices to their customers [48].

South Australia is predicted to reach zero demand during the middle of the day in 2023 during high solar insolation and/or windy periods [49]. This excess demand can be used to charge electric vehicles, but also for home energy storage, and to power appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines that can be set to timers. Air conditioners can also pre-cool houses using inexpensive energy, ready for the return of occupants later in the day. This may alleviate demand peaks in the afternoons of hot days.

Taking advantage of these schemes reduces the need for expensive network extension. This type of dynamic charging would also be beneficial for applications like switching on residential water heaters. There have been instances in the South Australian market where the entirely predictable cumulative load of timed water heaters has led to extreme price spikes, potentially due to collusion of generators [50].

However, these systems could be augmented with nearby renewable energy resources, or with battery storage. Rather than draw charge directly from the grid, and depending upon the frequency with which the system was used, this localised storage could then charge at a slower rate and charge at periods of low cost.

### Electric cars in 100% renewable electricity grids A separate project is investigating 100% renewable electricity in Australia [An Atlas of Pumped Hydro Energy Storage, Australian Renewable Energy Agency G00857, Blakers, Stocks, Lu, Nadolny and

## 10

Anderson]. In this work, we present an energy balance analysis of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in a 100% renewable energy scenario in which wind and photovoltaics (PV) provides 90% of the annual electricity. The key outcome of our modelling is that the additional cost of balancing renewable energy supply with demand throughout the year is relatively small - about half of the cost of balancing supply and demand on an annual basis. This additional cost is likely to decline in the future.

In our modelling, we avoid heroic assumptions about future technology development by only including technology that has already been deployed in large quantities (> 100 Gigawatts), namely photovoltaics (PV), wind, high voltage DC and AC (HVDC, HVAC) transmission and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES). Very wide distribution of PV and wind reduces supply shortfalls by taking advantage of different weather systems.

In our scenario wind and PV contributes about 90% of annual electricity, while existing hydroelectricity and biomass contributes about 10%. We use historical data for wind, sun and demand for every hour of the years 2006-10 and maintain energy balance between supply and demand by adding sufficient PHES, HVDC/HVAC and excess wind and PV capacity. We term the cost of these additions as the levelised cost of balancing (LCOB).

Using 2016 prices prevailing in Australia, we estimate that LCOB is $28/MWh, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is $93/MWh. This can be compared with the current wholesale market price in Australia of about $60/MWh. Another comparator is that the estimated LCOE from a new supercritical black coal power station in Australia is $80/MWh. LCOE is almost certain to decrease due to rapidly falling cost of wind and PV. With PV and wind in the price range of $50/MWh, the LCOE of a balanced 100% renewable electricity system is around $75/MWh.

Importantly, the LCOB calculated in this work is an upper bound. A large fraction of LCOB relates to periods of several successive days of overcast and windless weather that occur once every few years. Substantial reductions in LCOB are possible through contractual load shedding, the occasional use of legacy coal and gas generators to charge PHES reservoirs, and management of the charging times of batteries in electric cars.

soon, it is likely that electric cars will enter the market in large numbers. There are about 18 million registered cars in Australia. If the future fleet of cars is of a similar size but entirely electric, with an average of 50 kWh of useable storage per car, then the usable storage is 900 GWh. This is twice the optimum PHES storage envisaged in our modelling (400-500 GWh), and is much larger than the likely amount of stationary electrical storage in buildings. Unlike PHES, each storage cycle of a battery causes significant degradation, and batteries may therefore be significantly more expensive than PHES even in the longer term. However, timing the charging cycles is also effective in mitigating peaks in demand.

Solar and wind forecasting is already very good, and continues to improve. The combined output of thousands of wind and PV systems distributed over tens of millions of hectares can be predicted on every time scale from seconds to years. Even a fast-moving weather event takes hours or days to move over a significant fraction of the PV and wind generators (and thus affect generation). This allows ample time for supporting measures to be taken in the event of widespread adverse weather conditions, such as moderating demand or drawing energy from storage. Furthermore, the output of wind and PV systems is often counter-correlated - for example, cloudy weather is often windy.

## 11

In our modelling the most difficult periods to cover are typically cold wet windless weeks in winter that occur once every few years. During these periods the PHES reservoirs run down to zero over a few days because there is insufficient wind and PV generation to recharge them, leading to a shortfall in supply. The amount of PV, wind and PHES storage could be increased to cover this shortfall. However, this substantial extra investment would be utilised only for a few days every few years.

Good weather forecasting makes it possible to alert electric car owners to the desirability to charge their cars “this week, because next week there will be a shortage of sun and wind and charging prices will increase”. Mitigating the occasional shortfall by managing car charging allows avoidance of large expenditure (billions of dollars for a 100% renewable electricity system) on equipment that is very rarely used.

## Second-Life Batteries Energy density is critical for electric vehicle batteries, because range is determined by the energy carried within the car, and the amount of space available for a battery is strictly determined by the car envelope. In stationary energy system, the footprint of the battery system is not so important. Energy storage systems can be mounted to interior or exterior walls, or located within garages or basements. This flexibility has led to some companies introducing stationary energy systems made from used electric vehicle batteries.

The market is split into those researchers and car companies who believe second-life batteries are profitable, and those who do not. Battery chemistry and design, and the cannibalisation of secondary stationary storage businesses are probably both factors in these decisions.

## BMW have also partnered with PG & E with second-life battery banks to provide for peak loads, using 8 second life lithium ion batteries from their MINI E make. These are capable of providing up to 100 kW of energy when requested by PG & E. Between the two programs, BMW has participated in events with 24 hours’ notice, and 4 minutes’ notice [17].

Florida Power and Light are also interested in BMW's recycled batteries, and will be reusing 200 of these to test their peak shaving capabilities within Miami. This utility is also testing micro grid functionality, and the development of a portable emergency battery system, that could be deployed for important largescale events [51].

## Nissan is working in collaboration with Eaton to produce stationary battery storage systems, using both new and second-life Leaf batteries. The xStorage Home and xStorage Buildings products aimed at the home and business market have been unveiled, and residential customers in the UK can register for delivery in 2017 [52]. Details of xStorage Industrial [53] and xStorage Grid Scale [54] are yet to be released. Although the new and second-life batteries have different advertised energy capacity, both have an estimated 10-year life, assuming “certain conditions” [55]. Prices begin at £3,200. The specifications of the xStorage Home [56] and Building [55] can be seen below:

## 12

### Table 1: Specifications for the xStorage Home [56]

### Table 2: Specifications for the xStorage Buidling [55]

Webaxys, a data centre in France, has installed Nissan’s second-life batteries [57]. This is likely to be used as an uninterruptible power supply. Diesel rotary and lead-acid battery uninterruptible power supplies are frequently deployed in data centres. Lithium ion systems may be a better option than either.

## Tesla has repeatedly said that there is more value in recycling and reforming batteries than in giving them a second-life [58], and space within the Gigafactory has been assigned for recycling of batteries [59].

This presumably depends upon the battery chemistry, and the components. Car batteries have not been designed to cycle each and every day, and sometimes multiple times per day, as stationary batteries have been. Second-life batteries may experience even greater rates of degradation once they have been used to provide grid support [2]. In any case, the NCA cathodes used within Tesla’s EV batteries are not suited to stationary energy storage conditions [58].

## 13

This form of energy storage will only work well if it is highly predictable and reliable, otherwise the grid will experience problems, and a black out may even occur. The Tesla CTO has said that the company has looked into using second-life batteries numerous times, but each time have come to the conclusion that recycling is a better option [2].

Battery technology has also improved significantly. If a battery from a first-generation Roadster (2009) were to be recycled into a new system in 2019, this new product would have a higher energy density, and power capability. A current example of this is the new Renault Zoe battery, which has almost double the energy storage capacity of its predecessor, but only weighs 9% more [60], or the Tesla Powerwall 2, which has double the energy density of its predecessor after just one year [61].

Bloomberg Energy Finance have released a report that strongly supported the idea of second-life repurposing, and which estimated that there could be 10 GWh worth of redeployed EV batteries on the global grid by 2025. The price to refurbish and convert for storage purposes would be $449 per kWh in 2018 – compared to the price for a new battery of $1000 per kWh in September 2016 [62].

Underwriters Laboratories is developing a framework for testing and converting second-life batteries so that they can be safely deployed in the future [63].

Lux research has found that second-life batteries will “deliver questionable returns on account of reduced performance, limiting them to application (sic) with less frequent and shallower depth of discharge cycles”. The lead author of their report went so far as to say: “With present technology, recycling old batteries for new materials is the more economical option for creating the most value from existing materials… That said, innovations in areas like packaging and testing could tip the balance in the future, so companies should have plans for both recycling and reuse.” Lux published this figure, showing the annual global second-life battery supply, which depends upon the service life of the battery. 65 GWh may be available in 2035 [58].

Vehicle-to-train technology has been suggested in the UK, where the energy generated by trains braking as they approach a station could be fed into the electric vehicle charging stations for Park and Ride passengers, rather than carrying batteries on board the train. The stated intention was to then drain the energy from the cars to assist acceleration, which then reintroduces the problem of battery degradation [64].

Fleets of taxis controlled by Tesla and other companies would have different requirements from the cars discussed earlier in this report. If these fleets were being used in conjunction with road-based chargers, there may be no need for the cars to stop. Demand curves for passengers would likely follow the same patterns as today, with morning, afternoon and evening rushes for work, school, dinner and the return from late night entertainment. Stationary vehicles during the daytime could charge from surplus solar energy.

### A Note on Impacts to Range The size of the battery within an EV will determine whether it will be useful for many of these applications. The energy rating for several electric models are listed in the table below for reference. Even a large fleet of current model Nissan Leafs would have little impact upon the grid if all were used for Vehicle-to-Grid applications, and similarly, overnight camping inside a Nissan Leaf may not be possible due to battery depletion.

Factors that can affect the range of an electric vehicle (to varying degrees) include: driver behaviour, heating, cooling, music or radio playing, charging handheld devices, use of headlights, external temperature (cold air provides higher aerodynamic resistance than hot air [65], and powertrain components for both ICE and EVs have lower efficiency at lower temperatures [66] [67]), seat or steering wheel heating, the load within the vehicle, and any extra load, such as a trailer or campervan. The battery capacity of some electric vehicles that are available within the ACT, and their prices, are shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Electric vehicles available within the ACT, along with energy and pricing [4] [68] [69] [70] [71]

## Vehicle Tesla S Tesla X BMW i3 94Ah Nissan Leaf

## Energy (kWh) 60-100 75-100

## Cost in Canberra $113,319-242,799 $151,019-246,049 $69,462 $39,990

The impact of driver behaviour can be seen in Figure 5, which shows the impact upon range in a Nissan Leaf when hard acceleration or hard braking are used. Acceleration has a greater impact than braking, because regenerative braking recoups some of the lost energy [72].

The size of the battery will determine the impact of cooling and heating the car, and travelling during a hot or cold spell. Conventional cars use the waste heat generated by the engine to provide warmth to the occupants [73]. Electric vehicles use electric resistance heaters, or heat pumps instead [74], but the use of any extra energy consuming devices or settings will lower the total range available. Heat pumps are a far better option in terms of power use. The impact that external temperature and climate control will have on range is dependent upon the battery size, and the car design.

## 15

Figure 5: Nissan Leaf range (km) as affected by hard acceleration and hard braking [72]

FleetCarma collected information on the average, maximum and minimum auxiliary load used within Nissan Leafs over 7,375 trips, which can be seen in Figure 6. Low external temperatures typically resulted in higher auxiliary power use. Although lower temperatures have been recorded within alpine regions in Australia overnight during winter [75], very few Australian commuters would routinely experience them. FleetCarma also released a diagram for the Chevrolet (in Australia the Holden) Volt, which showed much higher auxiliary power loads. This is probably due to the larger heating system. The battery heater is rated at 1800 W compared to the Leaf’s 300 W system [65].

Tesla provides a widget on their website, which shows the change in range due to different external temperatures, different travel speeds and whether the heating or air conditioning is being used, for each

of their Model S makes. The impact of extreme external temperatures, and that of using climate control, can be seen in Table 4 for each Model S, travelling at 100 km/h [32].

For all but the lowest auxiliary power load, heating requires more energy than cooling, and so the range loss would depend upon the location. For the same driver, higher average ranges would be expected in Townsville than in Canberra, or Thredbo.

Whether a Leaf owner felt confident that camping in their car would depend upon the driver, the temperature at the camp site, the distance from a charging source, and the length of the trip. Connecting to the electricity grid at a camping ground circumvents all of these problems.

The Leaf currently on offer in the US has a 30 kWh battery [76], and there are rumours of 60 kWh Leafs being available in the future [77]. The US DoE released the following image in 2016, showing that modelled battery technology costs had decreased by 73% since 2008 [78]. With further price decreases expected [79], and more affordable long distance vehicles, such as the Tesla Model 3 [80] and Holden Bolt, hopefully making their way to Australia soon, anxiety over auxiliary power could be a thing of the past.

Figure 7: Cost reductions for wind, distributed and utility-scale PV, modelled battery costs and LED bulbs since 2008 [78]

## Conclusion Depending upon the way in which electric vehicles are integrated into our electricity systems, they have the ability to either increase the efficiency and contribute to lower costs for the entire network, or to create the need for large, costly expansions.

Automakers and research institutions are currently testing the water in attempts to uncover new revenue streams, which could benefit both these companies and the consumers who own their products. Now that the car manufacturers are moving into stationary storage, customer loyalty also plays a part. If a Mercedes driver purchases a Tesla Powerwall and likes the product, they may change their car as well.

Vehicle to grid and home, demand responsive charging and second-life batteries have all emerged in the market place as potential uses for electric vehicle batteries. Compared with V2G, demand responsive charging has greater positive potential with fewer problems. Batteries will not be degraded, and will be fully charged for consumers. Financial incentives may be smaller, but they will come with the assurance that a valuable asset is not being slowly undermined.

### Executive Summary Electric Vehicle Costs and Benefits

• Electric vehicles have recently entered the market place, and although uptake has not been strong in Australia so far, Norway, California and China have all experienced rapid uptake.

• These vehicles are quite different to conventional internal combustion vehicles, and have efficiency improvements, provide a more pleasant driver experience, can contribute to less noise pollution due to passenger transport in suburban areas, and eliminate carbon dioxide and smog emissions. Renewable energy penetration (and stability) in the electricity grid can also be supported with electric vehicles.

• Apart from the often-discussed drawbacks of high capital costs, charging time and range (which are all improving with time), some problems with battery chemistry and longevity have come to light. These issues are described in detail below.

• A model for the ACT fleet to transition to EVs is presented, along with three scenarios, which

deliver zero emission passenger transport by 2040, 2050 and 2060.

### M007: Electric Vehicle Costs and Benefits Within this report, the costs and benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) are discussed in comparison with the current status quo, where petrol, diesel and gaseous fossil fuels are used for passenger transport. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also briefly discussed. The use of hydrogen and other fuels for aviation and maritime transport has been discussed in the M004 report.

## 4

### Comparison with ICE Vehicles Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are gaining in popularity in key markets around the globe. They have begun to displace petrol and diesel vehicles in Norway and California, and receive government support in many countries. The change in technology and the different requirements of electric vehicles (EVs) when compared with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have resulted in some problems. This report will detail these issues, as well as the many benefits that EVs will bring, and will provide a comparison with ICEs.

## Zero Emissions Carbon Emissions Many countries have now pledged to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% or more by 2050. Emissions from all sectors of these economies will need to be lowered. It is already feasible to eliminate emissions entirely from the electricity sector, using solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, pumped hydro energy storage and other zero emission technologies. A clean electricity grid then enables the decarbonisation of other sectors, notably industry and transport.

The efficiency and emissions intensity of conventional ICE vehicles has improved over time. This has been encouraged recently by emission standards in the EU and the United States. In the former, standards for new vehicles are tightened every five years, and in the latter there are fleet-wide average targets that have been legislated for each year from 2017-25 [1] (although with these may be removed due to the change in President [2]). However, improving ICE technology delivers diminishing returns, because liquid fossil fuels will continue to result in net emissions, and ICE technology has an efficiency limit. McKinsey & Company has written “From a baseline of 130 g CO2/km in Europe today, we believe incremental abatement potential of ICE powertrain vehicles (including mild hybridization) could be around 25%. To reach these levels, automakers would need to pursue more aggressive engine downsizing, incorporate greater lightweight construction, rollout mild hybrid systems across the fleet, and enhance aerodynamics. Even with such additions, a sizeable gap to future regulatory targets likely exists, with each level of efficiency improvement more costly than the last” [3]. Some of these incremental improvements can be transferred to EVs, and so are not wasted.

If increasing efficiency standards drives up the price of ICE technology, then EVs will reach price parity sooner.

As will be discussed in Safety, a heavier and larger vehicle will generally provide more safety to passengers (although less to other road users!). Consumer desire for larger vehicles could jeopardise lightweighting, when SUVs and other oversized vehicles are purchased for urban driving.

## 5

Figure 1: Improvements to fuel efficiency will not result in less carbon intensive ICEs when compared to EVs, from [4]

Apart from the Federal vehicle emissions standard, ten U.S. states have adopted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) zero emission vehicles (ZEV standard, which mandates that automakers with annual sales of more than 60,000 must have at least 14% of the car fleet meet ZEV requirements [3] for model years 2015 to 2017 [5].

### Local Air Pollution and Smog Low emission vehicles are also in demand for the mitigation of the immediate effects of pollution, such as smog. Support for EVs in China has been largely influenced by this, and the reaction is being seen more and more globally. Los Angeles is well-known for smog [6], but now London is once again being referred to as “The Big Smoke”, Paris has had to temporarily ban vehicles from entering the city to reduce pollution [7], and has now instituted a ban on diesel vehicles manufactured before 2000 [8], and Oslo had a similar temporary ban for two days in January 2017 [9].

Apart from the aesthetic impact of smog, people are worried about the health impact. The harmful components in smog are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and nitrous oxides (NOx) [10], and use of liquid fossil fuels also result in the presence of carcinogenic benzene [11] and other toxic substances. The figure below shows the number of minutes spent cycling per day after which harm from air pollution outweighs the benefits of exercise [12]. Smog can cause chronic bronchitis in adults, episode of bronchitis in children, and trigger asthma attacks [13].

## 6

Figure 2: Minutes spent cycling each day for harm to outweigh benefits [12]

### Examples of Green Zones in Cities Berlin has had a Green Zone since 1/1/2008, but the restrictions on this zone were tightened in 2010 so that only cars with a ‘green’ sticker can enter [14]. The zone covers one third of Berliners, and has succeeded in lowering total exhaust emissions by 50%, and NOx by 20%. Careful data collection and impact measurement has contributed to ensuring court cases brought by opponents to the LEZ were not successful [15]. Several other German cities also have these zones, including Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Dusseldorf [16].

## London Previous incentives for the purchase of diesel cars were based upon laboratory tests, which suggested that diesel engines would result in lower overall emissions. The real-world emissions are five times those predicted. The diesel incentives were very effective, and now hourly PM2.5 concentrations in London have occasionally exceeded those in Beijing [17].

The City of London is also tackling emissions from public transport with the purchase of electric buses for use within the city [18].

### Figure 3: Air pollution shrouded London in April 2015 [19]

London has a designated congestion zone, with an £11.50 entry fee for entry from 0700 to 1800 on a weekday [20]. This is waived for Euro 5 equivalent vehicles, which emit less than 75 g-CO2/km [21]. A new additional £10 fee will be introduced in October 2017 for all vehicles meeting Euro 4 and lower standards [22]. A daily commuter could face almost £5,000 in congestion and emission fees per year – a strong incentive to change to a low emissions vehicle.

## Amsterdam has had a Low Emission Zone within the city since 9/10/2008, and aims to be emission free by
2025. The plan for this transition was developed with key input from taxi drivers and commercial interests to ensure that the local economy and jobs would not be adversely affected. Vans built before 2000 will not be able to enter the zone from 2017, and in 2018 taxis built before 2009, tour buses built before 2005 and scooters built before 2011 will be banned. Current permits for passenger vehicles will be unaffected, but new permits will not be available for petrol cars built before 1992 or diesel cars built before 2005 [23] [24].

## Planned Exclusions Paris, Athens, Mexico and Madrid jointly announced a plan to ban diesel cars from their city centres by 2025 in December 2016 [25].

In 2019, Barcelona will ban vehicles bought before January 1996 and vans bought before October 1994 from driving during working days [26].

Munich has been ordered to design a ban for implementation in 2018, through a court order “taken by Transport and Environment’s German member DUH to force action on Bavaria’s breaching of EU air pollution limits in some locations” [26].

## Danger of CO poisoning Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur when an ICE vehicle is used within an enclosed space, such as a garage.

## 8

Electric vehicles do not produce any carbon monoxide during operation. This means they can be used within an enclosed space without any risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

## Brake Pads The wear and tear on brake pads within ICE vehicles causes them to break down more quickly, and to release polluting particles as they degrade. Brake pads also heat up due to friction, the heat causing further degradation over time [27].

EVs typically use regenerative braking, which does not cause wear and tear on the brake pads – and so these do not break down and release particles. Brake maintenance will be further discussed in Maintenance below.

## Tyres The “instant acceleration” offered by EVs can result in more wear and tear and shorter lifetimes, but as usual, this is dependent upon personal driving style and will vary considerably over the population. The extra weight of an EV or HEV is also a factor [28].

Both ICE and EV tyres wear away over time, and small particles of the tyres are released into the environment.

### Cheating Emissions Standards The realisation that Volkswagen (VW) had been cheating emissions tests, and that diesel vehicles were not as clean as advertised, has led to a pullback in diesel vehicles in many areas. Whereas governments in Europe had once encouraged the purchase of diesel vehicles, France is now offering incentives for diesel drivers to switch to zero emissions vehicles [29].

Although the scandal began with VW, whose vehicles were equipped with an on-board computer that detected when an emissions test was being performed and cut NOx emissions accordingly [30], the ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club) released information that vehicles from Renault, Volvo, Jeep, Hyundai and several other automakers had real-world emissions many times higher than those tested [31]. The French government is also investigating Renault, and considering a complete ban on new diesel vehicles [32] [33].

Mitsubishi is also caught up in a scandal, after revelations that data from emissions tests were falsified and manipulated, and that employee complaints about this were ignored by management since 2005, with this practice beginning 25 years ago and likely a result of the corporate culture [34] [35] [36] [37].

A new test will be used from 2017, but even this will not fully capture the emissions from cold-starts and fully loaded vehicles [38]. The ICCT conducted a study of one million European passenger vehicles and found that advertised and real-world CO2 emissions diverged by 42% in 2015, substantially increasing from 9% in 2001 [39].

Lorries and small trucks are encouraged to install AdBlue technology within their vehicles through tax and toll reductions. The AdBlue filters out NOx from the exhaust. However, it has come to light that 20% of lorries operating in Eastern Europe are switching off the AdBlue filter, because the system costs more to run. This fraud costs Germany alone €110 million per year in lost toll revenue [40] [41].

## 9

Figure 4: Divergence between official and real-world emission values from the ICCT [39]

## Energy Security Australia currently imports 90% of its total liquid fuel needs, compared to 60% in 2000. This is likely to reach 100% in 2030 due to the closure of refineries. Purchasing oil from the international market means prices can be volatile, and are tied to events outside of domestic control.

In comparison, EVs can be powered with electricity which is generated from any source. Solar photovoltaics and wind, balanced with energy storage, can be domestic reproduced in most countries, and produce no emissions.

### Compatibility with Renewable Energy Many electricity grids currently include generation from fossil fuel power plants, and so EVs that charge from the grid have associated GHGs. As the generation mix in these grids begins to incorporate more renewables, which have different characteristics to traditional centralised power stations, EVs could play an active role in providing grid stability. With forethought and good planning, charging EVs can be made into interruptible loads, which can be easily switched off to accommodate changes in demand or generation capacity.

The Charge Point Charging Forward 2016 report [42] provided information on the average day and time that customers would plug in to Level 2 and 3 chargers. Level 2 chargers provide up to 22 kW of power, and are usually the highest rated chargers that are installed within work places and homes. Depending upon the EV, up to 140 km of range can be attained in one hour. Level 3 chargers provide up to 150 kW and are generally located in dedicated charging lots, and can provide up to 420 km of range in one hour. These will be discussed in further detail in Charging and Grid Impact. The results from the Charge Point

## 10

data are shown in the images below [42]. The Level 2 charging times in particular have a higher incidence during daylight hours.

Figure 5: Most popular days and starting times for Level 2 charging on the U.S. ChargePoint network [42]

Figure 6: Most popular days and starting times for DC fast charging on the U.S. ChargePoint network [42]

As higher renewable energy penetration rates are approached, a phenomenon known as the duck curve is occurring, where daytime solar power suppresses demand during the day, but does not last through

## 11

the evening load, for which generators need to be ramped up. Using controllable charging for electric vehicles to soak up solar electricity ameliorates this problem.

A recent study of 100% renewable energy futures based upon wind and PV shows that about 450 GWh of storage is required for grid stabilisation. If all 19 million Australian vehicles were electric, with average car battery size of 40 kWh, then this storage requirement could be easily met [43].

The installation of a photovoltaic array to provide emissions free electricity for the EV has attractive economics, as shown below:

1 kW of PV in a typical Australian city produces 1500 kWh/year. It costs $1800 to install (turnkey) and lasts for about 25 years. The simple cost is thus $72 per year.

The most basic Tesla S has a 60 kWh battery and 400 km range [85]. Thus, 0.15 kWh/km. With this PV system, a maximum of 10 000 km of range is available.

The most basic Nissan Leaf has a 24 kWh battery and 135 km range [270]: 0.178 kWh/km, so 8 437 km is available.

Taking a typical charging efficiency of 90%, a 1 kW PV array can energise an electric car for about 8,000 km per year. The simple cost of electricity from a PV array is about 1 cent per km.

Electrifying all of Australian transport would require 34% more electricity than is currently being used, with the vast majority due to passenger vehicles. The extra generation capacity needed to supply this energy could come from an increase in rooftop PV installations, as well as commercial scale renewable energy projects.

## Biofuels The use of biofuels has been extended to attempt to lower the emissions intensity of road transport. Modern petrol and diesel vehicles can use a blend of ethanol and biodiesel respectively. These can be incorporated at low concentration with no need to make changes to the engine or fuel tank [46] [47].

Over the time that bioethanol crops have been cultivated, distinct generations of technology have been developed. The increase in use of biofuels was largely a result of government policy [48], and was produced from corn crops in the United States and Brazil, supported by government incentives. As the corn ethanol industry expanded, new cropland was developed to provide crops for food and fuel, which caused further deforestation in other countries as food prices increased [49].

As this industry reached a peak in production, a range of factors resulted in food price hikes around the world. These factors included the commodification of food stocks due to uncertainty in real estate and share markets, drought and poor harvests – all of which were exacerbated by using food crops for fuel [48] [50] [51].

Predictions for the potential future amount of biomass available for heating and transport are frequently made based upon the results of smaller scale trials. Many factors mean that these trials have a higher yield than would be seen for a commercial crop. In a small plot, more plants are located on the outer perimeter, and so receive a greater amount of sunshine per day. The plants are cared for by hand, and so more attention can be paid to pests, nutrient deficiencies, and the final harvest. Overall higher yields can be obtained from the small plot [52].

Nitrogen-based fertilisers that are used to encourage strong growth cause nitrous oxide emissions, and nitrate run-off from farms. Water is also sometimes needed to irrigate crops (depending upon the type of plant used) [53].

Breeding cycles vary for energy crops. Annuals, such as sorghum are more straightforward, but longer lived specimens that require more time to reach maturity, such as willow, poplar and eucalyptus, can take many years to breed, and longer still to find the benefits in new cultivars [54] [52].

With the spectres of both climate change and population growth to contend with over the coming decades, dependence on climate dependent crops to alleviate climate change would be a great risk.

## Noise Pollution Noise pollution from busy roads, buses, and from trucks (for example rubbish trucks), impacts most cities. This is generally considered annoying, but exposure to noise can lead to hearing loss and impact heart disease, and also affect real estate value and utility of public spaces. A study from the United States EPA in 1981 found that at that time, half of the population “had annual exposures to traffic noise that were high enough to be harmful to health” [55].

## 13

Vehicle noise is the sum of engine, tyre, road and noise from aerodynamic resistance. Low frequency sound travels further than higher frequency noise, due to attenuation of the latter as it is absorbed by airborne water molecules.

Sound is measured on a logarithmic scale, and so an increase in 10 decibels results in a twofold increase in the apparent noise. The figure below shows a breakdown of the contributions to the noise from “properly maintained automobiles”, for which the tyre/pavement noise is dominant above 50 km/h. Faulty mufflers on ICE vehicles create excess noise – but with an EV there is no muffler, and so no chance that a faulty one will create excess noise [56] [57].

### Figure 7: Contributions to highway noise [56]

EVs eliminate engine noise, and the electric motor produces a more readily attenuated higher frequency noise. The increase in silent vehicles in residential areas does represent a challenge for people with poor eyesight, for children, and for those who are distracted (incidents where pedestrians are injured or killed whilst wearing headphones and crossing the street tripled from 2004-05 to 2010-11 [58]). Tyre and aerodynamic noise dominate at higher speeds and so EV’s will not ameliorate highway noise [59].

EVs also provide quiet cabins. This is not only helpful for conversation, especially when occupants are hard-of-hearing, but (depending upon the preferences of the occupants [60]) also provides a more pleasant and less stressful trip. Some people find this silence more eerie than pleasant, and so some vehicles come with a noise generator that mimics the sounds that a car would normally make [61].

Tesla cars are so quiet inside that the few noises that are heard can be used to diagnose issues within the vehicle [62].

BMW and Porsche have also been experimenting with the noise in the cabin for their ICE vehicles, the first playing a recording of the engine noise through the stereo, and the second incorporating an

## 14

amplifying pipe so the driver can hear the “bark” of the engine. Ford and Volkswagen have employed similar technologies [63].

## Capital Cost Although battery prices have seen an 80% fall over the past six years, new EVs remain more expensive than ICE counterparts [3]. This price difference is also due to the much smaller scale on which these vehicles are being made, some with only 1,000 vehicles per model.

Tesla in particular is well-known for pushing to increase the scale on which their products are made. Tesla is moving from a niche, expensive sports car, then to a luxury sedan and SUV, and now to an affordable everyday sedan whose price is in line with the average new car cost in the U.S. and has more than 400,000 orders months before its release.

Other automobile companies, such as Volkswagen, have suggested that price parity will occur from 2025, while other commentators have predicted this will occur by 2020 [64].

“These changes will make private EVs competitive with comparable … ICE vehicles by the mid-2020s on a total cost of ownership basis, and even earlier for high-utilization vehicles such as delivery fleets and taxis” [4].

Subsidies in the United States, the EU, and China have lessened the hurdle of capital costs.

The Tesla Model S is the best-selling model in the U.S. luxury sedan class, with 59% of the market in Q3

Demand for an affordable, longer distance EV does exist in Australia. The local market represents 1.5% of the global car market, and Australians made 1.6% of the total Model 3 reservations as of 14/8/2016. The Tesla Model 3 will be delivered to United States customers from the West Coast, then moving east, before deliveries begin to “Europe, APAC and right-hand drive markets” [99]. Although the car will be delivered to customers in 2017, it is unlikely that any Australian will have one until well in to 2018.

## 16

### Energy Efficiency and Running Costs Although ICE generally use liquid fuel and EVs use electricity, the overall energy consumption can still be compared. Even with round-trip battery losses, EVs tend to use 3 to 4 times less energy than conventional liquid fuelled vehicles [101]. This is due to the efficiency of the electric motor. Electricity in the ACT is much cheaper than in many other Australian states (typically 20 c/kWh vs 30 c/kWh).

Fuel efficiency in terms of carbon emissions per km depends upon the carbon intensity of the electricity source. The ACT has contracted sufficient new wind and solar photovoltaic farms to cover its entire electricity consumption [by 2020], and so electric car travel in the ACT is effectively carbon-free.

## Maintenance is important for all vehicles, as regular checks ensure the vehicle is running safely, and efficiently. When maintenance is not performed on vehicles, they can be not only dangerous, but also noisier and produce unwanted fumes.

## Battery Many EVs on the market today are relatively new, and their maintenance needs over a whole lifetime are not yet known. There have been many horror stories spread about the expensive battery replacements that will result in a huge cost to EV owners in the future, and unfortunately this has happened with early Leafs in hot climates like Arizona. This was a result of battery chemistry and high temperatures, as will be discussed below.

## 17

That problems with batteries have not been more widespread could be due to the type of people who are purchasing these vehicles. Early adopters tend to be interested in technology, and research their purchases more than a normal consumer, who might expect that they can simply use a new EV as they had used their ICE, and suffer no consequences. Range anxiety is not such a hurdle for those living in the inner city, with ready access to apps and technology to tell them where and when they can recharge, and for how much. However, a busy family living in the suburbs, or a person who is unfamiliar with smartphones may be more likely to find themselves stranded. Similarly, the normal consumer may not follow the ideal battery charging regime, and find themselves with an expensive replacement bill.

Battery life is dependent upon five factors, which are, battery chemistry, operational temperatures, high voltage or overcharging, low voltage or deep discharging, and high discharges or high charge current [102]. Capacity loss occurs both as a result of usage and as a result of storage – loss from the latter is termed calendar life [103]. EVs have a shelf life in the factory.

The table below shows the different temperature limits for three battery chemistries, and also provides information on the best way to charge when outside these limits. EVs have battery management systems (BMS) within them, which regulate the temperature of the battery.

Table 5: Temperature limits for three battery types. Best results are obtained between 10°C and 30°C [104]

Charge acceptance at 60° is 45%. No charge permitted below freezing. Good charge/ discharge performance at higher temperature but shorter life.

The Tesla Owner’s Manual says: “For better long-term performance, avoid exposing Model S to ambient temperatures above 60°C or below -30°C for more than 24 hours at a time”.

The Tesla cars sometimes make a whirring noise when they are being supercharged. This is the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) compressor, which is used to keep the battery temperature within safe limits, as well as to control the cabin temperature [62]. Drivers have experienced slower recharging while the battery was heated to a safe temperature from 0°C. Regenerative braking also does not work at low temperatures [105].

Owners of the 2011 and 2012 Nissan Leaf who live in Arizona, California and other hot regions in the United States experienced high capacity loss, and eventually sued Nissan. Nissan had not only misled consumers by telling them to charge batteries to 80% for longevity (but advertising the fully charged range), but also used a battery chemistry which was strongly affected by ambient heat. The passive battery climate control system was not powerful enough to protect these Leaf’s. The lawsuit resulted in Leaf owner with poorly performing batteries being eligible for a new battery free of charge [106] [107].

## 18

During normal charging, the voltage of the battery slowly increases, until it reaches its maximum voltage when it is fully recharged. If the battery is charged above the maximum allowable voltage, it may overheat, catch fire or explode – and the BMS prevents this from occurring [108].

Figure 9: The effect of charge voltage on cycle performance [109]

During normal operation, as ions move from the electrolyte to the electrodes, lithium moves to the graphite anode and becomes lodged there. This eventually becomes a film, which grows thicker with time and use [108]. Eventually, the barrier is so thick the battery cannot function [102].

The effect described above is more likely to occur when the battery is kept at high voltages for long periods of time, and especially so when it is at a high temperature. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that EVs not be charged to 100%. The 2011 and 2012 Nissan Leaf models had an 80% charging setting for this reason, so that drivers could set the car to charge to this lower and safer level, and only charge to 100% for those days when the entire range of the vehicle would be needed, and to time the charging event so that the vehicle would be used immediately rather than waiting with a fully charged battery. Unfortunately, this impacted the EPA range rating. Nissan offered the 80% charge as an option, and so the EPA used the 80% charged range as the official range. In 2014, this charge option was removed, and the range was raised from 76 to 84 miles. Regardless of this, many users continue to charge to 80% [110].

## 19

Figure 10: Battery design and the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) [102]

Figure 11: Capacity loss during operation within SoC bandwidths [111]

As shown in the figure below, supercharging a Tesla begins to level off once the 80% mark is reached, and fully recharging takes almost double the time that reaching 80% SoC takes.

## 20

Figure 12: Tesla Supercharger charging profile for 90 kWh Model S [112]

The State of Charge (SoC) describes the level of charge, and is 100% when the battery is full. The Depth of Discharge (DoD) describes the opposite, and is 100% when the battery is empty. Reaching a high DoD is detrimental to Li-ion batteries, and “Researchers have found that improvements in cycle life increase non-linearly as DoD is reduced” [102]. This can be seen in the table below:

Table 6: Discharge cycles versus depth of discharge for NMC and LiPO4 batteries [108]

Using the EV at a high DoD results in the battery having a lower voltage. to keep the power at a constant level, more current is drawn, which increases the temperature. This is also damaging for the battery [113].

For eligible vehicles, Tesla offer an over the air upgrade for the base model 60 kWh battery to unlock the 75 kWh that is really available. This means there is 15 kWh of buffer, so that the SoC is never 100% and the DoD is never 100%, which helps to lengthen the life of the battery [114] [115].

Tesla allows the owner to set the charge rate within the charge screen settings, as shown in the figure on the left below (from ConnecTT App), and the charge rate [116]. This and the scheduled charging option can be seen in Figure 15 below.

## 21

Figure 13: Charging limits available from the ConnecTT App interface [116]

Finally, constantly charging or discharging at high current includes supercharging, and examples of the latter could be driving extremely fast into a headwind up a hill while towing a caravan, or rapidly delivering electricity to the electricity grid through a Vehicle-to-Grid system. The two discharging examples are unlikely to occur frequently, but supercharging is a necessity for longer distance travel [117].

### is damaging. The former

A Tesla car will turn the air conditioning on when the car is too hot, to protect and cool the battery. When a Tesla or electric BMW is plugged-in and too hot, the car will draw directly from the mains to power the battery management system. This stops the battery from discharging [118] [113].

In summary, maintaining the battery involves some non-intuitive behaviour. It is best to keep the car plugged-in while it is parked at home, or if possible at work or other destinations, but also to limit the SoC during normal commuting to 80%. It remains to be seen whether consumers who are not interested in the technical reasoning behind battery maintenance will follow these rules, and care for their battery. In these cases, it is very important that the battery management system works to preserve the battery life.

Tesla provides this advice to its customers: “The most important way to preserve the Battery is to LEAVE YOUR Model S PLUGGED IN when you are not using it. This is particularly important if you are not planning to drive (sic) Model S for several weeks. When plugged in, Model S wakes up when needed to automatically maintain a charge level that maximises the lifetime of the Battery… There is no advantage to waiting until the Battery’s level is low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when charged regularly… Discharging the Battery to 0% may permanently damage the Battery” [118].

A new Nissan Leaf battery costs US$5,500 if the old battery is traded in [119] [120]. This price is before tax, installation fees or the conversion kit needed for the 2011 and 2012 models. Nissan are making a loss on the battery replacement price [121].

The Tesla replacement prices were announced in 2013 as US$10,000 for the 60 kWh version and US$12,000 for the 80 kWh version [122]. There is no longer an 80 kWh version, the closest being the 75 kWh and the 90 kWh. Tesla plan to lower the cost of batteries through the development of its Gigafactory and its successors, and so these fixed battery prices will hopefully fall in the future [123].

## 22

### Figure 14: Tesla Model S battery sizes [85]

In 2014, the Roadster 70 kWh battery replacement cost was announced as US$29,000 – the price reflects that they are built by hand [124].

### Current Maintenance Prices When compared to ICE, EVs are relatively simple. They have fewer moving parts, and certainly a lot less fluid that needs to be replaced. There are no oil changes, spark plugs, belts and other must-replace items in an EV. Instead, the controller and the charger are electronic devices and have no moving parts. As Tesla has demonstrated, over the air software updates can improve the functionality of the car, without a service visit.

Business models for servicing EV and ICE depend upon the company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said “Our philosophy with respect to service is not to make a profit on service. I think it’s terrible to make a profit on service. And, unfortunately the way the auto dealer association is set up is that they make most of their money service” [125]. Tesla offers software upgrades free of charge, but charges for maintenance checks. These now also include hardware upgrades for free. The warranty is not void if service checks are not made, but Service checks must be made for Resale Value Guarantee from leases. Tesla technicians perform house calls and will service a vehicle in the owner’s garage for a fee, as long as they live within a certain distance [126] [127] [128].

The price of the maintenance plan does not include faulty parts and systems. Different manufacturers may also include specialty items, for example Tesla not only provides free software upgrades over the air, but now also includes hardware upgrades within the service fee [127].

The EV Industry is still in its infancy and not many vehicles have been in service for a whole lifetime. To an extent to lifetime costs are still unknown. However, that has not stopped Tesla from selling maintenance (and insurance) bundled into the total price of the vehicle in some Asian markets. This certainly shows the level of confidence in their technology [129].

Studies investigating the market within the United States found that “Based on a comparison of five EVs across five automakers and their comparable size ICE counterparts from the same brands, EVs typically had 20-40% lower five-year maintenance costs” [3].

The publicly published prices for the Nissan Leaf and their similarly small model, the Nissan Pulsar Hatch, and the pricing for the Tesla Model S and the Mercedes-Benz CLS Coupe can be seen in the tables below:

Table 9: Mercedes-Benz CLS Coupe 250d maintenance plan [131]

The Tesla maintenance plan repeats and so in fifth year the owner can purchase the four-year maintenance plan once more. Mercedes-Benz does not provide this long-term set price certainty. The Tesla offer provides a discount for a longer plan, and so comparing these offers on an average price per year basis, the Tesla offer costs $763 each year, and the M-B costs $1193 each year [126] [131].

## Storage Several of the steps that need to be taken before long term storage of a vehicle are the same for ICEs and EVs. The car should be covered or in a garage, the battery should be maintained or disconnected, and some provision for the tyres needs to be made [132].

An ICE should be stored with fresh oil, because used engine oil could contain damaging contaminants. A full tank ensures moisture will not build up within the fuel tank and result in the seals drying out. A fuel stabiliser should also be added to the tank. The parking brake should not be used for long periods of time, or else brake pads and rotor may fuse together. A tyre locking chock should be used instead. The car should be started and driven around for 15 minutes every fortnight to recharge the battery and keep the engine and other components properly lubricated. If this is not possible, the battery can be disconnected entirely, or fed with a trickle charger that will keep the battery at an appropriate state of charge. The tires should be inflated to the correct pressure, and if the car remains stationary for too long the weight of the vehicle will cause flat spots to form [132].

Toyota suggests that hybrid vehicles in storage should be turned on once per fortnight for 20 minutes to recharge the auxiliary battery using the hybrid system, and once every two months for 30 minutes to recharge the hybrid vehicle battery [133].

The image below shows the schedule charging and charge current option available on the Tesla vehicle interface. The level of charge can also be set. Using these three controls means that a plugged-in car can be set to only charge when the electricity price is low, and to a level that will ensure battery health [134].

Figure 15: Scheduled charging and charge current settings from the Tesla touchscreen [134]

The Tesla app can be used to check on the state of the vehicle, which can be helpful in remotely determining whether the car has been unplugged or has experienced any other issue. If the vehicle is not plugged-in to charge, contacting it in this way will deplete battery more quickly, because after two days,

## 25

the vehicle enters a sleep mode. Other third-party applications, such as VisibleTesla, can be used which won’t “wake up” the vehicle [135].

### Figure 16: VisibleTesla wake up prompt [135]

Before leaving a Tesla vehicle in storage, the energy saving option should be turned on. This minimises the so-called “vampire drain” from the battery [136].

### Figure 17: Tesla’s energy saving option [134]

Norwegian Tesla owner Bjørn Nyland has published a video showing the process to remotely unlock and start a Tesla vehicle (from Thailand) so that a friend in Norway could drive it to a charger and top up the battery. Bjørn has also uploaded a video demonstrating the effects on his Tesla Model S after leaving it unplugged in a covered carpark for 27 days. The range ratings are shown in Figure 18 – over this period less than 1% of the range was lost per day. When the vehicle is restarted, the outside temperature is shown as -5°C. This low temperature means the battery must be brought back to an optimum operating temperature before the regenerative braking can be used. Apart from this, the car is in normal condition [134].

Figure 18: The change in range after a Tesla Model X was left in storage for 27 days in Norway [134]

## Spare Tyre Tesla vehicles do not carry spare tyres, but “In some markets, our trained tow providers carry a limited number of loaner wheels to quickly exchange for the damaged wheel” [137].

## 26

A trend towards selling vehicles with no spare tire has been seen in the United States, when 36% of 2015 model cars were sold without a spare tyre, an increase from 5% in 2006. This has two benefits from a carmakers perspective: the vehicle is lighter and so fuel economy standards increase, and the customer has more trunk space. To compensate many cars come with a tyre repair kit instead [138]. Tesla owners can choose to purchase this for $50 from the Tesla Shop [139].

The Nissan Leaf does come with a spare wheel in Australia – but does not in the United States and other markets [140].

The presence of a spare wheel is dependent upon the car company and model, and generally not on whether the car is EV or ICE.

## Brakes Theoretically, regenerative braking should result in less wear and tear on the traditional friction brakes. Once again, the major EV models have been in service for less than 10 years, and so the problems that have come to light could be simply outliers, and also the result of earlier designs that have since been changed. A Tesla Model S driver from Canada, who had purchased his vehicle in December 2012, noticed a rattling in the brakes in 2016, and so booked it in for service at the Tesla service shop. It turned out that due to the salt on the roads in winter, and lack of use, the traditional friction brakes had seized up and needed to be entirely replaced. This cost C$8,500, which is on par with the costs charged by other luxury automakers. The driver was told to brake heavily a couple of times per week to engage the friction brakes. The service technician also suggested that the brake fluid should have been changed each year. Since this service visit, the Tesla maintenance now includes bi-yearly brake fluid changes (although it is not clear whether the change was a result of this incident) [141].

The Nissan Leaf also requires the brake fluid to be changed each year, because the friction brakes are used when descending a hill or mountain, rather than the regenerative braking, in case too much power overloads the system and cause a fuse to blow [142].

This is similar to ICE vehicles, except that in non-saline environments the brake pads should have a longer lifetime.

## Service Centres The number of service centres for EVs is not a problem or benefit inherent within the technology itself, but rather an indication of the infancy of the market. Tesla only have two shopfronts thus far in Australia, but there are plans for growth.

## Smash Repairs There are only two recommended body shops for Tesla vehicles in Australia – one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. Again, as the size of the market increases, Tesla will hopefully increase the number of approved body shops [143].

## 27

Figure 19: Tesla body shop locator shows no option for Russell, Australian Capital Territory [143]

## Warranty The warranty on new ICE vehicles is dependent upon the manufacturer, with a legislated minimum of one year to seven years with Kia [144]. Most major brands have three year warranties. Warranties demonstrate confidence in vehicle design and technology, and allay consumers fears about potential problems with an expensive new purchase [145].

The main component in an EV that causes consumer angst is the battery. This is relatively new technology, and a large component of the total vehicle cost. Purchasers do not want to need to replace the battery within a few years.

The Nissan Leaf has an 8-year 160,000 km battery warranty in the United States [119], but the Australian website only has a guarantee for the first 12 months for unlimited kilometres [146]. Nissan in Canberra say the battery is guaranteed for five years and 100,000 km in Australia, but that this information is not available on the website.

The Tesla Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty provides cover for “the repair all replacement necessary to corrects defects in the materials or workmanship of any parts manufactured or supplied by Tesla that occur under normal use for a period of 4 years or 80,000 km, whichever comes first” [147].

The Tesla Battery and Drive Unit Limited Warranty provides vehicles with an eight-year battery and drive unit warranty. The base model is only covered for 200,000 km, but the others have unlimited mileage included. This “covers the repair or replacement of any malfunctioning or defective Battery or Drive Unit, subject to the limitations described below”, of which the most relevant to the battery is that it cannot be used as a stationary power source. Tesla also note that “The Battery, like all lithium-ion batteries, will experienced gradual Energy or power loss with time and use. Loss of Battery Energy or power over time or due to or resulting from Battery usage, is NOT covered under this Battery and Drive Unit Limited Warranty” [147].

## Total Cost of Ownership As discussed above, although the capital cost of an EV is higher than that of an ICE, maintenance and running costs are lower. In the table below, the initial price of the EVs currently available in the Australian market and their approximate eight-year total costs are shown along with a comparable ICE vehicle. These prices were checked on the 28/2/2017 for ACT. The average ACT driving distance of 13,200 km in 2014 was used for each case [44]. The ActewAGL residential electricity price was used to find EV operating costs, and the average 2015-16 petrol and diesel prices were used for the ICEs [148]. A real discount rate of 3.1%, based upon the current mortgage rate and inflation rate. The advertised fuel used per 100 km was used, and so fuel costs for the ICE are probably higher. The BMW i3 and Nissan Leaf both begin at a similar price to their ICE counterpart, but cost thousands less over the course of their lifetime.

This has a worse fuel rating than the diesel equivalent – the hybrid engine provides power and performance rather than fuel economy

## Waste and Recycling Apart from the vehicle itself, ICE technology produces waste throughout the usable lifetime. This includes waste oil, spark plugs, brake pads, brake fluid, air conditioning filters, and tyres – many of these are produced from EVs as well. Sustainable feedstock, production and either reducing, reusing or recycling the final products will be necessary for both EVs and ICEs. For example, tyres have been produced from sugars derived from biomass (not fully sustainable) [149], and also recycled for oil, steel and carbon black [150].

Australian lead-acid battery recycling rates are quite high, due particularly to the toxicity of the lead. Old batteries are used to produce new batteries.

The major difference between an EV and ICE is the lithium-ion battery. As discussed in M002, currently the global recycle rate for lithium is less than one percent. In order for EVs to be a sustainable long-term mobility option, lithium recycling rates must be increased. The Tesla Gigafactory has facilities for recycling, and unlike other carmakers, recommends that the batteries be recycled immediately rather than using them as second-life stationary battery storage (discussed in M005). Many public Australian commentators have been questioning the increase in stationary battery storage, asking how the lithium would be disposed of. As long as Tesla branded products were returned to a Gigafactory (Tesla have suggested that three more will be built – one could be located in Asia, or even Australia), this lithium would be recycled, but other brands such as BYD and Nissan, have not detailed their end of life plan – apart from Nissan buying back old EV batteries.

In general, the value of lithium is sufficient that high levels of recycling are likely to be established once there is sufficient volume to justify it on a commercial basis.

Many commentators suggest that batteries that are no longer suitable for EVs being repurposed, and undercutting the stationary storage market at prices of around US$49/kWh. Energy density is very important for EVs, but not so critical for stationary storage, particularly commercial and grid scale storage [4].

A company in the US has been purchasing model S battery packs from vehicles that have been scrapped. They break down the pack into components parts, then either sell them online or retrofit them to convert classic cars to electric [151].

## 30

## Driving Experience Speed and handling The Tesla Model S P100D is the fastest car in production in the world, and third overall, coming in after a Ferrari and Porsche that only have space for two passengers and are no longer being produced [152]. The instant torque and quick response, along with the lack of gear changes to disrupt the smooth acceleration, provides an enjoyable ride. The quick acceleration can mean overtaking on the highway is safer and more predictable. In the following figure, the acceleration of a Nissan Leaf (orange) is compared with that of a conventional ICE (green):

Figure 21: Comparison of the acceleration of a Nissan Leaf (orange line) and ICE (green line) [153]

Whereas ICE vehicles are limited to installing the heavy engine under the bonnet, EV designers can balance the load more carefully, so that the vehicle has a centre of gravity that is closer to the centre of the vehicle, and at a lower level [154].

## Heating System Conventional ICE vehicles use waste heat from the engine to heat the interior, and during winter passengers must wait until the car has heated up before they are as well.

EVs use heat pumps instead, which produce heat from electricity, and so are productive from the moment the car is turned on [155]. Heat pumps are found in refrigerators and reverse-cycle air

## 31

conditioners, and essentially use electricity to move heat. The heat pump in a car compresses a refrigerant to generate heat, which then enters the cabin and heats the passengers much more quickly than an ICE heater. One unit of electrical energy can be used to generate up to seven units of thermal energy in the best class of residential air conditioners. This ratio between the electrical and thermal energy is known as the Coefficient of Performance (COP) [156].

## Cargo Space The cargo space available in an EV is dependent upon the manufacturer. For example, BMW have sacrificed space and weight to make one of the most efficient EVs on the market. Tesla have kept the empty space, and offer a front trunk in addition to the back trunk [157] [158].

Hybrid vehicles that have both a battery and a conventional engine can be space-poor, and have a smaller trunk than equivalent ICEs, or oddly shaped spaces that are less useful. Examples of this are the Honda Accord Hybrid, or the Ford Fusion Energi Hybrid [159] [160].

## Connectivity Multiple applications exist for use with Tesla vehicles, which have been released by both Tesla and third parties. These can be used to remotely start the car, summon the car, honk the horn and flash the lights, set an alarm based on charging activity, activate camping mode, remotely optimise the cabin temperature, track performance statistics, and perform many other tasks [161] [162].

This use of smart-phone applications could invite problems with cyber-security, and hacking. A Tesla car was hacked at a distance of 19 km in China, and many components could be remotely controlled, including the brakes, the seats (which were moved backwards and forwards), the sunroof and boot. Tesla have since updated the software to guard against this method of intrusion, but other attacks are possible [163].

## Towing Some electric vehicles have been criticised because they’re not able to tow a load. The Camry hybrid, for example, is only able to tow 300 kg [164]. This is dependent upon individual manufacturers, and in fact footage of a Tesla Model S towing a Tesla Model X to recharge the Model X battery using regenerative braking has surfaced. Tesla does not condone this as a method of recharging [165].

## Privacy All new Tesla vehicles are manufactured with self-driving capability and the sensors that will be used to “view” traffic and other obstacles. Autopilot can only be used if access to this function is purchased from Tesla. Regardless of whether the driver uses this functionality, Tesla can collect data. Data sharing is automatically turned off for Tesla vehicles in the EU, but turned on for vehicles in the U.S. Other car companies are beginning to incorporate these sensors [166] [167] [168].

## Driving through Water Wet roads can cause aquaplaning for both EVs and ICEs, and driving through a puddle that is hiding a pothole can cause damage to either type of vehicle.

Driving through a flooded area can cause problems for the engine of an ICE, and eventually “drown” it, destroying the engine and electronics [169].

## 32

The Tesla Model S can be driven through water, and Elon Musk has confirmed that the vehicle is well- sealed enough to be used as a boat for short periods of time, with the wheel rotation providing thrust (although this is certainly not recommended) [170]. A driver in Miami drove his Tesla Model S through almost 60 cm of standing water to get home, and received a message from his car that it needed service and “may not restart”. Upon arriving home, the car allowed to charge port to open but would not accept charge. In the end, his problem was not a result of driving through the water, and the “guys at the Service Center (sic) said the car held up remarkably well in the water” with “no real damage to anything structurally and the water didn’t get into anything it shouldn’t have” [171].

## Safety There is less risk of rolling over in an EV compared with an ICE, due to the low centre of gravity (the Model X Tesla technicians were reportedly unable to rollover the vehicle during tests). The batteries also increase the total weight of the car. Heavier and larger cars typically provide better protection for their occupants during a crash with a lighter, smaller vehicle. There is also a lower probability of fatalities occurring for those in the larger vehicle [172].

Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) built fifteen years ago were not designed with compatibility of other vehicles on the road in mind. This meant that during a collision with a smaller car, the other driver had a higher chance of fatality. Changes in design in both smaller vehicles and SUVs have mitigated this risk, and in 2011 the IIHS reported that “the threat posed by SUVs isn’t much bigger than cars of the same weight” [173].

However, these large vehicles create other problems for other road users. Their bulk blocks visibility at intersections, their larger size can create problems in parking – either from their doors opening on to other cars, again blocking visibility for cars leaving their parking spot, the higher vantage point enjoyed by the driver means the headlights are also positioned higher and so shine into the eyes of oncoming traffic or into the rear-view mirror of the driver in front. These problems would still exist if all vehicles were electric.

There have been several EV and PHEV fires over the past decade, in several countries including the United States, China, Mexico and Norway [174]. Details of some of these incidents will be discussed below.

In 2011, “a Chevy Volt caught fire nearly a month after completing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash test. The NHTSA concluded that the fire wasn’t the result of a defect in the Volt’s design and issued a statement to the public that such events don’t constitute an increased risk of fire compared to conventional vehicles” [175].

In 2012, a BYD E6 taxi was hit by an ICE vehicle being driven by a drunk driver at 180 km/h. The taxi was immediately engulfed in flames, killing the passengers and driver [176].

Fisker Automotive also experienced fires. This luxury carmaker filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and the purchaser transformed it to Karma Automotive [177]. The fires included an un-plugged car within a garage in Texas caught fire with no explanation, and faulty wiring caused a Californian car to catch fire [178] [179].

## 33

In 2013, a Tesla Model S in Washington drove over a large piece of metal that had fallen from a truck. The metal pierced the battery, and the car warned the driver that there was a problem. The driver pulled over in plenty of time, before the car was engulfed in flames. Tesla have since released a software update to increase the default clearance when travelling on a highway, and redesigned the titanium shield beneath their cars. The company now says that there is “virtually zero” chance of a battery fire caused by the damage in this way. Their warranty does not cover damage from running over items on the road [180] [175] [181].

Following this incident, Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a press release comparing ICE and EVs, saying “A typical gasoline car only has a thin metal sheet protecting the underbody, leaving it vulnerable to destruction of the fuel supply lines or fuel tank which causes a pool of gasoline to form and often burn the entire car to the ground. In contrast, the combustion energy of our battery pack is only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank and is divided into 16 modules with firewalls in between. As a consequence, the effective combustion potential is only about 1% that of the fuel in a comparable gasoline sedan” [180].

A supercharging Tesla Model S caught fire in Norway in 2016. The car and the two supercharging stations were destroyed, but no-one was injured. The cause was identified as a short circuit within the distribution box of the car, but due to the damage of the vehicle, the cause of the short circuit could not be determined. A software update to include a diagnostic test to check that a short circuit could not occur was released to lower the chance this type of incident could occur again [182].

Also in 2016, in France, during a test drive of a Model S with a company representative and two prospective buyers, an “improperly tightened” electrical connection caused the car to go up in flames. The car warned the driver, who pulled over, and everyone exited the vehicle. Within five minutes, the car was entirely engulfed. In the manufacturing process, robots would normally have tightened this connection, but a human had performed this work instead [183].

Battery management systems provide information on the battery state of health, including information from individual cells. These systems can alert the driver to problems, and disconnect the battery if necessary. The cells are separated by the cooling system, and generally groups are separated by firewalls. The ability that Tesla has to change the way the vehicle functions through software updates, and so fix many problems that have come to light, shows real innovation.

During the development of lithium batteries, lithium metal was used. This had high energy density, but a low melting point. When the battery reach a temperature higher than the melting point, thermal runaway occurs, which can be likened to the domino effect. The heat from the first failing cell is passed on to the next, which also becomes unstable. Lithium-ion has a higher melting point, but lower energy density and so represents a safe compromise [184].

The number of EVs in use does not approach that of ICE vehicles, but on a proportional basis, there have been far fewer incidents than would statistically occur for conventional vehicles. ICE vehicles in the United States experience 287,000 fires per year, compared with 263 million in 2015. These cars can explode on impact [185].

The majority of EVs sold in the United States and Australia either meet or surpass the legislated safety ratings, potentially to encourage consumers to justify the high purchase price. The Tesla Model S was

## 34

awarded the highest ever safety rating in 2013 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States, and the Nissan Leaf has an advanced air bag system and electronic stability and traction control, which similar ICE vehicles do not have [186].

### Emergency Services and EVs While there is coverage of an unfortunate incident where a Tesla was driven through a garage wall and into a pool and the driver was unable to unbuckle his seat and exit the vehicle, there are no news stories of emergency services personnel being injured while responding to an emergency involving an electric or hybrid vehicle [187].

Emergency services in the Netherlands were hesitant to remove the deceased from his vehicle, because they were worried about electrocution [188].

Tesla provides an information page for first responders, providing specific details for each of their models [189].

### Figure 22: Tesla Model S no cut zones shown pink [189]

## Higher Utility EVs have lower operating costs than conventional vehicles, and so are more suited to high utility purposes, such as taxis, delivery vehicles and emergency vehicles. This benefit has been recognised globally, and taxi fleets from Beijing to Madrid are being converted to electric [190] [191].

Australia Post ran a year-long trial using the Renault Kangoo in 2014 [192]. Deutsche Post has gone further, and actually produced an electric van in-house, using parts from outside suppliers. These have been designed for a 16-year lifetime, working six ten-hour shifts each week. A Deutsche Post board member commented: “It did not cost billions to develop and produce. You will not believe how cheap it is to make”. 5000 vans per year are being produced, and used throughout Germany. These have replaced Volkswagen vehicles – and Deutsche Post is considering selling these vans to other delivery companies [193].

A typical privately owned residential vehicle can spend more than 90% of the time empty [3]. Companies like Uber and Lyft have provided a platform for people to monetise their car. Those drivers using a hybrid or EV will use less petrol, and overall lower running costs.

## 35

Thirty cities in the United States are announcing that they are interested in purchasing 114,000 EVs for local government use, including police cars, street sweepers and rubbish trucks. The cities have been in discussion with automakers, and expect the purchase to cost US$10 billion, which is around US$88,000 per vehicle – but this includes heavy duty trucks as well as passenger vehicles [194].

## Range Anxiety The advertised ranges of the main vehicles available on the Australian market were provided in Table 4. Among the pure EVs, the lowest was 120 km with the 2012 Nissan Leaf, and the highest was the Tesla Model X. The Nissan Leaf 2018 model will be unveiled in late 2017, and may be available in Australia in
2018. This will have a longer range, with early reports indicating that anywhere from 400-550 km could be available [195] [196]. Tesla announced the removal of the 60 and 60D Model S from their line-up in March 2017 [197].

As the price of Lithium-ion batteries falls, and the technology is further developed, larger batteries will be cheaper, and also have higher energy density. As long as some charging rules are followed, the batteries in these vehicles should remain in a good state of health, because the full range will not be needed most of the time.

Figure 23: A comparison between price and range of new electric vehicles [198]

## Charging and Grid Impact There are three main types of chargers, as shown in the Table below. These have different charging speeds, and prices. Most household charging can be performed with a Level 1 or 2 charger, while DC fast

## 36

charging can be reserved for longer trips. This is not always the case – the Vice Ruler of Dubai has a supercharger installed at his house [199].

## Pros Everyday Convenience Recharging from home or work means that most normal commuting and weekend travel can be easily supplied from overnight charging. Rather than line up at a petrol station every week or fortnight, many EV drivers only need to recharge at other locations during long trips.

Petrol stations are unpleasant, with the smell of petrol and diesel, and although tanks can be filled within minutes, the driver needs to be there physically holding the nozzle into the car. Recharging an EV does not require the presence of the driver, who can plug in, then immediately use the amenities, purchase something to eat, or go for a walk, before their phone lets them know that the battery is full. On the other hand, the charging time is typically 30 minutes. Public charging points tend to be placed in attractive locations.

IKEA has begun to install superchargers within their car parks, as a marketing ploy to lure customers. As recharging can take half an hour, IKEA has a captive audience for their cafeteria or homewares centre. IKEA is also well-known for installing solar PV on their roof, and so customers are re-charging with zero emissions energy [208].

Many shopping centre car parks use red and green lights to indicate whether a park is available. The power cables that have been retrofitted could potentially also be used to provide power to electric vehicles through a basic 240 V plug (the lights are LEDs and so do not require very much power to run). This would deliver 12 A, which, although the lowest possible charging power, is sufficient to provide a minimum of 21 km over three hours, depending upon the vehicle. Rather than going to the cinema to

## 37

watch a movie then stopping at the petrol station on the way home, EV drivers wouldn’t need to stop at all. This extra convenience costs less than a dollar per hour for the shopping centre [209] [210].

## Charging on longer trips All Tesla vehicles sold before the 15th of January 2017 have free access to superchargers, which can be used for long-distance travel. Those sold after this date have access to 400 kWh of free supercharging per year, with a charge of $0.35/kWh in Australia to be implemented thereafter [211] [212]. Depending upon weather conditions, while charging the Tesla may make a humming noise due to the battery temperature control [213].

A map of Australia showing the destination charges, super chargers, Service centre charges and store charges that are available for Tesla customers within Australia and around the Canberra region can be seen in the images below. Canberra Tesla owners can drive north of Brisbane and to the west of Melbourne without going beyond the public charging system.

## 38

### Interruptible Load, and Reduced Network Augmentation If appropriate systems are used for EV charging in residential and commercial settings, these cars can be an interruptible load. If a problem occurs on the electricity grid, for example generation capacity is lost, or demand suddenly increases, the charging EVs can be temporarily halted or slowed, to allow for more flexibility within the system. If all the passenger and light commercial vehicles in Australia were electric and had 50 kWh of storage, there would be 800 GWh of EV storage [215]. The number of cars plugged-in and charging would depend upon the day and time.

Within the Australian National Energy Market, a distribution network business estimated that it was only during 23 hours per year that 20% of the network capacity was used [216]. Using interruptible loads to stop EVs charging during hot summer afternoons can help with this problem. Smart charging systems should be used in all home and workplace chargers. This system would stop charging for a short period of time. For longer periods, such as an hour-long halt, it would be important to involve consumers, and give them an optional override in case they need their range. This could be a user pays system, where the driver recognises that electricity is more expensive at that time, and agrees to the higher charge. Conversely, agreeing to take part in the demand control program could provide the consumer with financial rewards. These systems have been described in M005. It would be more difficult to stop a supercharger, as this would be like stopping the petrol pumps at a station, and would cause major inconvenience to users.

An electric ferry in Norway has been built to run from two 520 kWh batteries on-board, to transport vehicles and passengers six kilometres over a fjord. to recharge without overloading the grid, the ferry plugs into a 260 kWh battery on each pier, and quickly charges from this. Once the charge is depleted, the pier battery trickle charges back to capacity. This system was installed so that the network

## 39

did not need to be augmented. The ferry has also been designed to deliver a 40% energy saving compared to a conventional ferry [217] [218] [219].

### Figure 25: Electric ferry in Norway [218]

Solar carports with built-in batteries deliver similar benefits. Rather than delivering solar power to the grid during the day, the system retains the clean electricity, and delivers it to the EV when it arrives home. This system does, however, involve two round-trip charging losses. The carport also serves to keep the cabin of the car cool for the occupants, which then saves energy when the air conditioning is not needed [220].

Councils should include lighting upgrades along with the installation of fast chargers. Lighting upgrades could save Australia $100 million per year, because 50% of Australian street lighting is still mercury vapour, and only 9.5% is LED. A 400 W mercury vapour light can be replaced with a 110 W LED [221]. Changing to a smart framework, where these lights could be dimmed to support the overall network, could also be beneficial [222]. This would free up night time capacity on the substation, and while it may not provide enough power for a supercharger, does provide enough for a Level 2 charger.

McKinsey and Bloomberg New Energy Finance produced the following demand curves exploring the impact upon the weighted average emissions from different EV charging conditions using an electricity grid that had fossil fuel generation capacity as well solar. The weighted average emissions for flexible charging decreased from 253 gCO2/kWh in 2015 to 76 gCO2/kWh in 2030, even with limited EV penetration [4].

## 40

Figure 26 Weekday electricity demand curves for different charging regimes [4]

## Future Charging Wireless chargers are currently available for many of the EV models on the U.S. market, and although they sacrifice some efficiency compared to cabled chargers, they can be much more convenient. Plugless, a U.S. company, says its chargers are 12% less efficient than Level 2, and 7% less efficient than Level 1 systems with cords 41[223].

The next step would be to install these chargers into the road. WAVE, or Wireless Advanced Vehicle Electrification, a U.S company, has demonstrated their 250 kW Wireless Power Transfer System prototype, and plans to deliver these systems to a Transit Authority in California in late 2017. This system is aimed at buses, and the charging occurs while the bus stops to pick up and set down passengers. It is designed to allow a top-up in the charge while the bus is travelling along a route [224]. Mercedes-Benz will release the S550e with wireless charging through its partnership with Qualcomm [225].

As more EVs enter the fleet, the length of time a vehicle takes to charge while on a long trip may become more than an annoyance. Using a conventional service station, a driver can refuel and be back on the

## 41

road within 10 minutes. If they are planning a longer stay, they will move their vehicle to a parking spot, freeing up the bowser. Given the increased time needed to recharge an EV, all other factors remaining as they are, the same service station would need at least three times the number of charge points. Supplementing this system with in-road charging may free up infrastructure and increase user amenity.

## Cons ICE Battery Charging Running out of battery in a conventional ICE vehicle can occur when headlights are left on overnight. Starting the ICE car requires another vehicle, or in the worst-case scenario, a service visit from a road-side assist technician. Running out of petrol on the way to the station means a walk with a jerry can full of flammable liquid.

Prices for petrol and diesel are tied to international prices, which have suffered from volatility in the past, and potentially resulted in wars.

### Toxicity of Petrol and Diesel Fumes Petrol contains known carcinogens. These are benzene and 1,3-butadiene. Exposure to benzene increases the risk of leukaemia and other blood diseases, and 1,3-butadiene causes cancer in many organs [11] [226] [227].

Petrol is unfortunately used to obtain a damaging high in some areas. In some areas of Australia, petrol that has been treated so that these effects are not available is sold. This is typically more expensive than providing conventional petrol, but the Australian Government provides a subsidy so that it can be sold for the same price. 170 sites across Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia stock the fuel [228].

### Charging Network Growth and Planning is important for EV chargers. Apart from those in homes and at offices, the placement of public chargers is important to ensure they are useful and accessible. This will increase their use and utility. The implementation of chargers may be curtailed by the capacity at substations. A study of EV implementation in Switzerland found that problems could be experienced at substations once EV penetration reached 50% [229].

Were the EV market to grow more quickly than chargers could be built, or supplied, consumers would face long queues at charging stations, and potentially risk running flat. If this sort of lack of investment were to occur, it would likely be short-lived, because companies would recognise that they could provide the service for a fee. In addition, it is more likely that demand for EVs would outstrip supply to Australia, and so companies and local governments would have sufficient time to plan and deploy infrastructure.

### From Range Anxiety to Charging Anxiety As EVs have gained market share, drivers are now worried about whether there will be charging spots available. Some Tesla supercharging stations were being used as free parking, with cars left in place long after charging was finished. Tesla has moved to address this with costs on idling cars ($0.55 including GST per minute in Australia) [230], and also by providing real time information about the number of charging spots available from the Tesla dashboard [231]:

## 42

Figure 27: Supercharger availability information for Tesla vehicles [231]

This has sometimes resulted in a preference for hybrid cars, so that (more available) petrol can be used instead [29].

## Risk of Vandalism Superchargers could be tampered with, and then used by unsuspecting drivers. This could cause fire or electrocution [232].

## Second-Hand Market The second-hand market is very important for many people, and provides a means for the purchase of otherwise out of reach products. For example, in the United States, “only 25 percent of new Model S buyers earned less than $100,000 per year, that number rises to 36 percent of all used Model S buyers”, and the second-hand market also skewed towards younger owners. There are very few EVs available second hand on the Australian market [233]. This will likely remain the case until there is large take up in government and commercial fleets.

Australian law also forbids the importation of second-hand vehicles until 2018, after which cars less than 12 months old can be imported from Japan or the UK as long as 10% GST and 5% import fees are paid. These cars will also come with less consumer protection. While New Zealanders are able to purchase imported second-hand Leafs for around $20,000, the Australian second-hand market does not provide much choice. The increase in the NZ market has come at a cost – Nissan no longer stocks new Leafs there, a move which has frustrated fleet purchasers [234].

## 43

There has been rapid change and development in new EV technology, so that different model years have quite different characteristics and problems. This represents a challenge for second-hand purchasers, as for example, choosing the wrong Nissan Leaf could result in the need to purchase a new battery.

The Nissan Leaf in the US has also had almost yearly iterations overseas, but only the 2012 version has been available in Australia. As discussed in the section Battery above, this model had problems with battery degradation. Although there is a five-year warranty period, the new version to be released in 2018 will have a much higher range and updated battery chemistry [235].

Very few Holden Volts were sold in Australia, and these were removed from Holden showrooms in 2015 [236]. International Volt owners have reportedly not experienced problems with batteries, and there have not been any battery replacements due to capacity degradation [235]. As of the 17th March, there were no Holden Volts advertised on CarSales.com.au.

Tesla is a prime example of an electric car manufacturer which has tinkered and tweaked their design, to rectify problems as they arise. This has resulted in a current Model S that is significantly different from the original design. The 2012 and 2013 models experienced some issues with reliability, but the 2014 and later models remain good options [235].

New Tesla vehicles that are leased through the financing option are guaranteed a resale value, as long as the included kilometres are not exceeded, and other stipulations followed [237].

Tesla have begun offering showroom and pre-owned vehicles for sale within the United States on their website. This includes information on price, location, distance travelled, a cash price for pick-up, and estimates for transportation costs, and many also include free supercharging. Both the Model S and Model X vehicles receive “a full inspection, remaining battery and drive warranty and a four year, 50,000 miles new vehicle limited warranty with 24 hour roadside assistance” [238].

### Figure 28: Tesla showroom vehicles option [238]

## 44

Before purchasing a used EV, the prospective driver should take it on an extended test drive to ensure there are no problems with range, watch the vehicle charging to check for problems, ask for information on the state of health and charge, if possible use an app that can analyse this information and detail any hidden problems, and finally, enquire about battery warranties and cost replacements.

## Taxes and EVs There are several ways in which conventional vehicles are taxed in Australia, at both the Federal and State level. These are shown in Table 12, and include fuel excise, vehicle registration and stamp duty, and driver’s license fees. Over the period 2001-02 to 2008-09, the fuel excise made up more than half of the total revenue each year – excluding GST and Fringe Benefit Taxes, for which data is not available each year. As can be seen in

Table 13, the rates are $0.401 per litre from 1 Feb 2017 for petrol and diesel, and $0.03556 per litre for gasoline used as fuel in an aircraft [239] [240].

EVs do not incur fuel excise, and so in the future the tax system will need to be changed to recoup this lost revenue, as EVs will still result in similar levels of wear and tear on public infrastructure.

## Fleet Transition As discussed in Total Cost of Ownership, EVs can have a lower lifetime cost than ICE counterparts today. As battery prices decrease, the benefit in purchasing an EV will increase further. When paired with a move to a 100% renewable energy electricity grid, a fleet transition to EVs would represent the decarbonisation of a second sector. The ACT will have a clean grid from 2020 (i.e. all electricity comes from contracted wind and solar PV farms), after which transport emissions contribute 60 to 80%, depending upon the use of stationary energy for heating, as discussed in M002.

Fleet transitions can be modelled using adoption curves [241]. The adoption curves for historic uptake of various new services and appliances can be seen in Figure 29 below. It is interesting to note that many of the most recent new services introduced to the market have had extremely quick update, for example the mobile phone and Internet. Appliances that either complement or improve upon earlier iterations, for example mobile phones and VCRs, also saw higher rates of uptake.

Figure 29: Adoption curves for historical uptake of new services and appliances [241]

A report from McKinsey and Bloomberg New Energy Finance model potential uptakes of EVs, and suggested that a consumer appeal and benefits of EVs may result in a much faster transition than the base case scenario. The trend from these two scenarios is compared with Norway’s trajectory in the following image [4].

## 46

Figure 30: EV adoption curves for base case, regulator-driven, and innovation and imitation curves [4]

Figure 31 shows a theoretical breakdown of the market into “types” of consumer, and their cumulative impact upon total market share. In Norway, EVs are being purchased by early adopters and the early majority, but in many other countries, only the innovators are active in the market.

Figure 31: Breakdown of the consumer population according to purchase habits, and impact upon the adoption curve [242]

## 47

These groups of consumers typically have different reasons for purchasing EVs, and different requirements from their vehicle. For example, innovators may be technically minded, want to be seen with the latest in new technology, and have sufficient income to support this preference. A Tesla owner in China financed the installation of several Tesla chargers to drive his car home from Beijing to Guangzhou [243]. The figure below shows other types of buyers, along with a potential time in which they could enter the EV market [3].

Figure 32: EV purchaser demographics currently, soon, and in the long-term [3]

In China, many people have recognised the benefit of the lower overall cost of ownership, and the income of those consumers purchasing EVs is now lower than those are buying ICE vehicles [3].

Changes in consumer reasons for purchase are already being seen globally. For example in the U.S. and Germany, EVs were initially valued for economic and environmental benefits, whereas now many more factors are taken into consideration [3].

## 48

### Figure 33: Changes in EV owner consideration [3]

The average age of a car in the ACT is 9.3 years old, but in reality, these vehicles can remain for a much longer period [215]. The figure below shows the make-up of the appliance stock in Australia, using a 10- year lifetime with a two-year standard deviation, to show the possible longevity of older models. This “old stock” lifetime is an important consideration when discussing a transition away from fossil fuel powered vehicles [244].

Figure 34: For an appliance with a ten-year lifetime and two year standard deviation, the oldest models can still be in use 17 years after the purchase date [244]

Fleet transition also depends upon the models of vehicles available. Consumers not only need vehicles that lie within their price range, but issues such as trust. Although Tesla and other new-comers to the

## 49

auto market have produced innovative and well-performing vehicles, consumers are still more willing to trust established companies [3].

Figure 35: Consumer trust in EVs from different types of automakers in the U.S. and Germany [3]

### Hybrids: Stepping stones to Decarbonised transport Although capable of driving in pure electric mode, many hybrids sold on the market today have less than 50 km zero emission range. After this point, the system switches to petrol or diesel. Thus, hybrid cars can cause many of the problems associated with conventional ICE vehicles. Unless carbon neutral fuel is used alongside renewable electricity hybrid cars will never be entirely clean. The combination of an electric and conventional system introduces more points of failure and maintenance than a pure EV. The utility of the vehicle can also be compromised due to the need to include both batteries and an engine.

The table below shows the average annual electric and total miles driven by the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt studied within a report released in 2015 by the Idaho National Laboratory. The Chevy Volt drivers on average drove an extra 3,100 miles in petrol mode. The total distance driven by the Leaf was within 1,600 miles of the national average annual. As battery technology improves, and prices decrease, pure EVs will be capable of performing the vast majority, if not all, of the passenger vehicle travel that is currently undertaken with ICE vehicles [245] [246].

Table 14: Annual average miles driven in electric and petrol mode for the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt studied by the Idaho National Laboratory in 2015 [245] [246]

The image below is from Miotti et al. 2016 for the US market, and compares life cycle emissions with future targets (2050 total US emissions 80% of 1990 levels), and the need for a change within the system. Electric vehicles do not meet the 2050 target due to the current grid electricity mix [247].

## 50

Figure 36: Lifecycle emissions and lifetime costs for new vehicles in the US market [247]

There are several other factors that will influence the speed of the transition to EVs. Once the tipping point is reached, ICE maintenance and parts will be even more expensive than for EV due to low volumes, further increasing the financial benefits of the switch. Similarly, the total volume of liquid fuel being transported to Australia would decrease, resulting in a higher cost per unit. The ChargePoint Charging Forward 2016 report found that “Having EV charging available at work makes employees 20X more likely to drive electric” [42].

### A Transition Scenario: Taxis in the ACT Taxis within Canberra have rapidly shifted from 5% hybrids in 2012 to 75% in 2015, demonstrating the possible speed of transition to a more cost-effective technology [248] [249].

Table 15: Taxis within the ACT were 75% hybrid in 2015, up from 5% in 2012 [248] [249]

## 51

## Fleet Transition Model The following fleet transition model was prepared using information about the passenger vehicle fleet within Canberra, to demonstrate the new market EV penetration that would be needed to reach zero emission for this mobility mode by 2040, 2050 and 2060. The image below shows the three new market penetration curves used. In these three scenarios, 50% EV market penetration is reached in 2024, 2029, and 2039, and 100% is reached in 2034, 2047 and 2065. The scenarios do not include hybrid vehicles, nor do they include the second-hand market.

The application of these three market penetration curves to fleet volumes can be seen in the following three images.

### Comparison with Hydrogen and other emerging technologies Hydrogen can be used as a fuel in either converted ICE vehicles, or as a fuel for fuel cells, which produce on-board electricity which can be used to run an electric motor. Commercial interest in hydrogen is in the latter technology [250].

When compared with conventional ICE vehicles, BEVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) share some similar benefits. The electric motor used in both is more efficient than ICE motors. Use of both can also result in zero emissions – this will be discussed in the section below.

Toyota has been the main producer of hydrogen vehicles, and as of February 2017, has sold 2,840 cars within Japan, California, Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Honda, Hyundai, Lexus, Audi, GM, and a range of newcomers have also moved into this space. The Japanese government in particular has been a great advocate for hydrogen, both in transportation and in stationary energy the Prime Minister commented in January 2017 “Hydrogen energy is an ace in the hole for energy security and measures against global warming. Thanks to deregulation, a hydrogen society of the future is about to begin here in Japan” [251].

BEVs and HFCVs differ in many ways. BEVs are able to use regenerative braking to further increase efficiency. The main infrastructure to transport electricity already exists, and is available directly to

## 54

consumers (albeit at lower speeds than those available at superchargers). In comparison, hydrogen infrastructure does not exist, and would be costly to implement due to safety issues and the high pressure under which hydrogen is stored.

Lithium-ion batteries do have intrinsic safety issues, but battery design and monitoring provides methods to limit the danger to people. Similar design methods have been used to keep passengers safe within the Toyota Mirai. It has two carbon-fibre reinforced hydrogen tanks, which are lined with plastic and surrounded with reinforced glass so that a puncture is visible. The tank is surrounded by sensors to detect hydrogen leaking, and if this does happen, the car shuts down the hydrogen system and turns the car off. Toyota have released a video showing their tank being shot with a high calibre weapon. The hydrogen released dissipates into the environment, with no other effect. The cabin is also sealed so that hydrogen gas cannot enter it [252] [253].

The hydrogen molecules are very small, and can leak from the vehicles over time. Recent studies have found this excess hydrogen would not contribute significantly to air pollution [254].

Hydrogen vehicles currently have a longer range than EVs, and can be re-fuelled more quickly at a hydrogen fuel station. As discussed already in this report, these two issues are being addressed with research efforts for future EVs. During the initial design phase at Tesla, HFCVs were considered, but the many problems meant that Li-ion was chosen instead. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said “It’s just very difficult to make hydrogen and store it and use it in a car. If you, say, took a solar panel and use that…to just charge a battery pack directly, compared to split water, take hydrogen, dump oxygen, compress hydrogen…it is about half the efficiency” [251].

HFCVs are being used by very few consumers, and have not had a long lifespan on the road. Other problems and benefits can be expected to become apparent over time.

## Zero Emissions Whereas batteries represent an interruptible load, hydrogen electrolysers are most efficient, and therefore cost effective, when run continuously [255]. Unless the facilities were built with on-site energy storage, they would not support the integration of a higher proportion of solar PV and wind. This extra energy storage would increase the total cost of the hydrogen.

## Other Future Issues

## Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely expected to become popular with the advent and improvement of self-driving technology, and to go hand-in-hand with the transition to EVs [3]. This has been spearheaded by Tesla, but other car companies are beginning to implement this within their models. Nissan has deployed their ProPilot technology [256] [257], and Volkswagen [258], Mercedes-Benz [259], and Toyota [260] (amongst many others) have unveiled a self-driving car, with BMW [261] and Ford [262] both announcing that they would also like to have an AV available by 2021.

There are five levels of autonomy, from 0 to 4. Rand Consulting has defined them as [263]:

## 55

• Level 0: the human driver is in complete control of all functions

### • Level 1: one function is automated

• Level 2: more than one function is automated at the same time (e.g., steering and

acceleration), but the driver must remain constantly attentive

• Level 3: the driving functions are sufficiently automated that the driver can safely engage in

## other activities

### • Level 4: the car can drive itself without a human driver

A Tesla vehicle using the Autopilot function is classified as being Level 2 autonomous [264]. In October 2016, CEO Elon Musk announced that all new Tesla vehicles would be manufactured with the hardware necessary for full Level 4 autonomous driving. This includes 12 cameras with 360° vision and 250 m range, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward facing radar. The data collected by these systems is fed into an on- board computer [265].

### Figure 37: The new Tesla hardware has 360° vision [265]

This section will highlight some of the problems and benefits of AVs.

### Autonomous Vehicles and Privacy Potential problems with privacy and autonomous vehicles (AVs) have already been seen, as an Uber executive allegedly used the application’s “God” view to track a journalist who had been publishing negative articles about the company [266].

Privacy is a common issue with new technology that provides convenience. Smartphones began breaking down this barrier, as did specialised internet advertisements. Many people are happy to give away personal data in exchange for convenience. Discussions about AVs having access to personal information, to provide personalised advertisements from local stores along transport routes have been aired [267].

Tesla (and other companies) have also been collecting information from their cars, in Tesla’s case to determine a baseline between their autonomous driving and human driving.

## 56

### Autonomous Vehicles and Safety Driver error causes 90% of vehicle accidents [268], and so this is commonly cited as a reason why AVs should be not only developed, but implemented as soon as possible. Tesla have tested this by collecting data from vehicles before and after the rollout of their autopilot system, and found a 40% decrease in crashes [269].

However, critics argue that there could be a rebound effect – where passengers become over- comfortable and stop using seat belts, instead buckling them up behind them, or other risks, such as cyberterrorism [268].

### Autonomous Vehicles and Employment Uber is particularly interested in AVs, as the human component of their business is one of the costliest. By removing their drivers, Uber may finally begin to make profits. Unfortunately, the taxi and Uber drivers will be unemployed and have skills that are no longer in demand.

Truck driving is another area in which autonomous vehicles could result in widespread job losses.

AVs may also affect police employment, as AVs will theoretically no longer commit traffic offenses.

### Autonomous Vehicles and Ridesharing AVs used with smartphone applications allow for an increase in ridesharing. This electric, autonomous and shared passenger vehicle transport could be “30-60% cheaper per mile can a private vehicle, depending upon the number of people sharing the ride”. This would be an attractive option for many consumers, and allow those with less purchasing power to enjoy the benefits of EVs [4].

### Autonomous Vehicles and Public Transport and Infrastructure If the cost of AV transport were to equal that of public transport, there could be a shift (whether occasional or permanent) away from public mass transit. In the worst-case scenario, public transport infrastructure could be stranded, and roadways congested with the increase in passenger transport [4].

AVs will theoretically also drive in the most efficient manner possible – for both car and road. Smart transit systems could set daily limits on systems so that wear and tear on roads is controlled and can be easily accommodated into infrastructure renewal schedules.

### Autonomous Vehicles and Extra Travelling The impact of AVs on total distance travelled is unknown. There are many factors that could influence this including increases in total passenger vehicle mileage due to the ease of travel, empty vehicle travel once the passengers have been dropped off or due to vehicles travelling to meet the consumer, and also, as discussed above, due to the systemic shift from other modes of transport. Historical price elasticity has shown that a 10% reduction in the price of car travel results in a 4% increase in demand. The possible reduction in costs of 30 to 60% mentioned above could there for increase demand by 12 to 24% [4].

Looking to other areas, after the price decreases the 50%, the demand for mobile minutes, data and air travel increased by up to 150% [4].

## 57

## Conclusion Many EVs on the market today have been in commercial production for fewer than 10 years, and yet have several advantages over conventional ICE vehicles, not least of which their rapidly-reducing total ownership costs and (generally) superior drive experience. Problems do remain, and more will likely come to light as more companies enter the market, and consumers make the switch from fossil to electric.
