## Introduction

Transport for NSW (TfNSW) welcomes the Senate Select Committee’s inquiry into the use and manufacture of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Australia. TfNSW has coordinated this submission, with input provided from the Department of Planning and Environment and the Department of Industry.

## 1.1

## Terms of Reference

The Senate Select Committee on EVs will inquire into and report on the following matters:

a) the potential economic, environmental and social benefits of widespread

### electric vehicle uptake in Australia;

b) opportunities for electric vehicle manufacturing and electric vehicle supply and

value chain services in Australia, and related economic benefits; c) measures to support the acceleration of electric vehicle uptake; d) measures to attract electric vehicle manufacturing and electric vehicle supply

### and value chain manufacturing to Australia;

e) how federal, state and territory Governments could work together to support electric vehicle uptake and manufacturing, supply and value chain activities; and

### f) any other related matters.

## 1.2

### TfNSW response to the Terms of Reference (ToR)

TfNSW is currently leading a whole-of-government Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Action Plan (detailed in Section 4). This plan, and proposed policies and initiatives to support EVs, is still under development.

The submission responds directly to ToR (e). The NSW Government’s positions on the other components of the ToR will be contained in the forthcoming Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Action Plan.

## 1.3

### Definition of Electric Vehicle

In the context of this submission, the term ‘Electric Vehicle’ is applied to vehicles where an electric motor provides all or part of the vehicle’s propulsion.

### Transitioning to Electric Vehicles

After a slow start, Australia’s adoption of EVs is accelerating, and is likely to have a major impact on road transport within a decade. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s ‘neutral scenario’ forecasts that EVs will comprise 1.5% of new vehicle sales in 2020 and 17.3% in 2030.

Bloomberg NEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook 2018 predicts that Australian plug-in EVs will increase from less than 0.2% of new car sales in 2018 to 1% in 2020 and 6% in 2025.

Modelling undertaken by Energeia for ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation forecasts that, even without government intervention, EVs will comprise 1% of new vehicle sales in 2020, 4% in 2025 and 22% in 2030.

Challenges to Electric Vehicle uptake in the Australian market

Limited model choices and high cost, relative to equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles, have contributed to the slow uptake of EVs in Australia. Future Transport 2056 cites that EVs can currently cost $15,000 more than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles.

The acceleration of EV take-up will be in response to their becoming increasingly price-competitive. Several experts predict that the purchase price of EVs will fall to the level of equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles by the mid to late 2020s, in response to falling battery prices and the economies of mass production. Model choice is also expected to improve over the coming years.

According to McKinsey and Company, the total cost of operation of EVs is likely to reach parity within about three years (2020-21), because EVs are cheaper to operate than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## 2.2

### Opportunities for NSW in transitioning to Electric Vehicles

Future Transport 2056, the NSW Government’s vision for transport in NSW over the next 40 years, notes that alternatives to traditional automotive fuels have several benefits, including:

## •


lower costs for users – running costs are one third to one quarter of traditional vehicles (although up-front costs are currently higher) reduced air pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to internal combustion engine vehicle

### • health benefits from air quality improvements •

reduced noise from vehicle operations (particularly buses), which improves the amenity and liveability of places improved energy security through reduced reliance on non-renewable imported fuels.

## 4

The NSW State Infrastructure Strategy 2018-2038 also notes that the transition to EVs could assist NSW to meet the targets in its Climate Change Policy Framework, noting that “the transport sector contributes 20 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, with road based transport – cars, commercial vehicles and buses – contributing over 85 per cent.”

### Transport for NSW response to ToR (e)

There is an opportunity for federal, state and territory Governments to provide clear and coordinated policy leadership through developing nationally consistent charging standards and more stringent standards to reduce vehicle emissions.

## 3.1

### National Charging Standards

TfNSW strongly supports a nationally consistent approach to EV charging standards. Certainty in national charging standards would help EV charging infrastructure providers and EV manufacturers to invest in EVs with reduced risks, and would provide more certainty to consumers.

To progress a nationally consistent standard, TfNSW has encouraged the Transport and Infrastructure Council (TIC) to include electric vehicles within the scope of an updated Action Plan for the National Policy Framework for Land Transport Technology. The proposal was supported by most jurisdictions at the Transport and Infrastructure Senior Officials Committee. It is expected that TIC will support cooperative action on EVs, starting with consideration of national standards for EV charging infrastructure.

Industry has also nominated charging standards as a high priority for coordinated national action. For example, the Electric Vehicle Council has stated that picking standards for AC and DC charging would streamline infrastructure deployment, reduce costs, avoid legacy and redundant charging stations, and reduce confusion in the market.

## 3.2

### Vehicle emission standards

The Federal Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions, established in 2015, is leading the whole-of-government approach to reducing motor vehicle emissions in Australia.

TfNSW supports the development of these more stringent standards for fuel efficiency, vehicle CO2 emissions and fuel quality for light vehicles.

The introduction of CO2 emissions standards for light vehicles would deliver a broad and comprehensive policy that could encourage the update of EVs.

## 3.3

### Implications for fuel excise and potential road pricing

NSW recognises that the transition to EVs will have implications for road funding, including a further decline in fuel excise revenue. This transition might strengthen the case for road pricing reform, but action must be carefully designed to ensure that it not delay the take up of EVs and their benefits. Loss of fuel excise revenue is already occurring due to more fuel-efficient vehicles, and penalising EV owners will do little to support future revenue.

It should also be noted that growth of EVs should have a long-term positive impact on the budget, because lower running costs should allow the ATO to reduce work-related

vehicle expenses claims. Fuel costs of EVs are 66-75% lower than for petrol vehicles, and maintenance costs are 33-50% lower.

## 3.4

### Opportunities for further intergovernmental collaboration

The NSW Government believes there could be opportunities to use relevant COAG Councils and other intergovernmental forums to discuss, develop and implement nationally coordinated measures to support EV uptake.

Opportunities to engage across Government include through the:

• Transport and Infrastructure Council (TIC) - There is an opportunity for TIC to coordinate intergovernmental agreement on national charging standards for EVs.

• COAG Industry and Skills Council Regulation and Innovation Working Group - the NSW Department of Industry attends on behalf of the NSW Government. This national forum supports nationally consistent, innovation friendly regulatory environments to encourage the introduction of new technologies and innovative business models, while ensuring a level playing field for all industry participants.

• Building Minister’s Forum and the Building Codes Board - Through these

boards governments could investigate opportunities to facilitate EV infrastructure in new residential and commercial buildings through Australia’s building and construction regulations and standards.

• COAG Energy Council - EVs could complement priorities of this group

through promotion of energy efficiency, energy security and improved energy infrastructure, and the encouragement of technological innovation.

### NSW Government Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan

Future Transport 2056 and the State Infrastructure Strategy 2018-2038, recognise the significance of the transition to EVs. These strategies were developed in parallel and published together in March 2018.

While NSW supports an industry-led response to the development and take-up of EVs and alternative fuels, Future Transport 2056 also recognises that the NSW Government has a role in preparing for the transition to EVs. The following actions are included in Future Transport 2056:

Investigating the opportunities for, and challenges of, EV use in NSW.

• Delivering an Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan that outlines NSW Government actions to facilitate the take-up of low emission, fuel efficient vehicles and maximises their benefits for passenger and freight mobility, productivity and liveable communities.

TfNSW has commenced development of an Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan. The Plan will include policies, strategies and actions designed to:

• prepare NSW for the transition from Internal Combustion Engine vehicles to

## EVs

• support and accelerate this transition where it can be demonstrated that this

would enhance or bring forward desirable economic, social and environmental outcomes.

TfNSW expects that the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan will be released in late 2018.

## 4.1

### Current NSW Government Electric Vehicle initiatives

The Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan will build upon many existing initiatives to support the transition to EV and other fuel efficient vehicles. Existing initiatives include:

initiating the first trial of fully electric public transport buses as an integral part of the contract to operate Sydney Bus Region 6. The trial will be undertaken by the new operator, Transit Systems, and will involve four battery electric buses from July 2019.

• Trialling the State’s first automated, electric passenger shuttle at Sydney

### Olympic Park in partnership with industry.

• Providing a lower rate of motor vehicle tax for hybrid and electric vehicles in

### line with the Commonwealth’s Green Vehicle Guide.

• Recommending that charging stations be included into apartment designs

under the Department of Planning and Environment’s Apartment Design Guide.

## 4.2

### Industry input into the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan

Industry, including the automotive and energy industry, is at the forefront of preparations for the transition to EVs. TfNSW supports industry taking the lead in the development of EVs and supporting infrastructure.

This is exemplified by the work of peak industry groups including the Electric Vehicle Council and Hydrogen Mobility Australia. The Australian Logistics Council, which represents freight transport operators, has recently announced the formation of an Electric Vehicles Working Group “charged with developing policies that promote greater manufacture and uptake of heavy vehicles in Australia.”

It is also important that government help prepare for and support EVs, and this should be done in consultation with industry. The NSW Government considers industry input is integral to the development of the NSW Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Plan.
