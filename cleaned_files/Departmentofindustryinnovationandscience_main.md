## About the department

The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (the department) facilitates the growth and productivity of globally competitive industries. It also supports the building of a strong scientific capability, business innovation and the commercialisation of new ideas as critical requirements for productivity and economic growth.

The department works closely with industry, businesses, the science and resources communities, Innovation and Science Australia, Australia’s Chief Scientist and other stakeholders to help build a globally confident and outward looking Australian economy through supporting science and commercialisation; growing business investment and improving business capability; and simplifying doing business. The department also works across governments to open up resources and other export markets, and support economic development in northern Australia.

## Executive summary

There are opportunities for competitive Australian businesses in producing automotive components and services in the supply chains of the global automotive manufacturers. Some Australian businesses already supply these markets with highly innovative systems and components. These include batteries, fast charging systems, battery cooling technologies, lightweight high performance materials such as carbon fibre, and vehicle body components using lightweight materials. More Australian businesses could supply these emerging markets by drawing on our excellent R&D capabilities.

The Australian Government has a range of programs that build business capabilities in many aspects of Australian manufacturing and services. These programs can help businesses to participate in the global supply chains of multinational car makers manufacturing EVs. The programs include the: $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund; Automotive Transformation Scheme; Entrepreneurs’ Programme; Industry Growth Centres Initiative; Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) program; R&D Tax Incentive; and CSIRO.

The department is experienced in working with other Commonwealth portfolios and agencies, state governments and industry for the benefit of industry. For example, the Commonwealth Department of Jobs and Small Business, Department of Employment, and Department of Education and Training and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science collaborated with the South Australian and Victorian state governments, Holden and Toyota in developing and delivering the Government’s $155 million Growth Fund. The Fund supported automotive workers in their transition to other careers and supply chain businesses to diversity and invest in new activities.

Ford currently makes one fully electric vehicle, in its Focus range. It has a wider EV program in China through Ford’s joint venture with Chinese automaker Anhui Zotye Automobile, specifically to build EVs and a ‘strategic collaboration’ with Alibaba to build new online and digital sales channels.16

In Australia, Ford has a product development centre at Broadmeadows in Melbourne, an R&D centre at Geelong and Proving Ground at Lara. With these facilities, Ford will continue to design, engineer and test vehicles its vehicles for global markets. In 2016, Ford transformed its Melbourne head office into a new product development centre as part of a AU$50 million investment to enhance vehicle engineering capability and drive innovation in Australia. In addition, Ford was increasing Australian R&D investment by 50 per cent to $450 million in 2017 to support increased vehicle development programs. By the end of 2017, Ford’s investment supported 2,000 jobs in Australia, including 1,750 engineers, designers and technicians.17

The centre continues to be enlisted for major projects in the Asia-Pacific region, including R&D for Chinese Ford models. 18 The centre developed the new-generation Ranger ute – to be built and sold in the US for the first time in 2019 – and the reborn Bronco SUV that shares the Ranger’s platform. It is scheduled to arrive a year later.19

## Toyota’s global R&D program has many R&D centres in the USA, Japan, Belgium, Germany, France, China, Thailand and Australia. It is predicted to spend US$9.4 billion on global R&D, up from US$9.3 billion in 2017.20

In Australia, Toyota’s R&D operations in Victoria include: product design with clay modelling; vehicle evaluation; multimedia development; and customer quality engineering. They are supported by 150 engineering, design and technical training jobs.

Toyota has a diverse range of new energy vehicles and concept vehicles. These include increasing the energy density of the next-generation of batteries, the use of silicon carbide (instead of silicon) as a new material to improve fuel efficiency, and a wireless charging system. 21

Toyota recently released two new EV concepts, primarily for urban congested roads. They are the i-ROAD, an ultra-compact size 870 mm wide, and the iQ EV which takes up half a normal parking space and has a more compact battery.22

Toyota has a long history in R&D in fuel-cell technology, with it exploring hydrogen energy since 1992. In 2002, Toyota began the world's first limited sales of a fuel-cell vehicle, the ‘Toyota FCHV’, in Japan and the US. Toyota has also made use of its hybrid vehicle technology in the development of fuel-cell vehicles. Notably, Toyota has given free access to approximately 5,680 fuel-cell related patent licenses (as of January 6, 2015) to promote the widespread early adoption of fuel-cell vehicles and build a hydrogen-based society.23

Toyota released its mass market plug-in hybrid, the Prius, in January 2012 and updated the model in 2017, with longer driving distances in EV mode due to an improved Li-ion battery and motor. If the car is driven until the battery runs out, it can carry on operating in the minimal-CO2-emission hybrid mode. 24

In September 2017, Toyota and Mazda announced a deal with automotive components manufacturer Denso to establish a new company – EV Common Architecture Spirit Co., Ltd. – that will develop technologies for EVs. The company will have around 40 engineers from the three companies who are to create framework technologies for electrification. The technology will be implemented across a wide range of vehicle types, from smaller cars to light trucks, across the Toyota and Mazda brands. Toyota intends to open a US$1.6 billion US assembly plant for EV and hybrid vehicles.25

## GM has been working on fuel-cell and battery EVs for over two decades.26 Its R&D expenditure for 2017 was US$7.3 billion, up from US$6.7 billion in 201627 In 2017, it announced it would produce 20 battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles by 2023. Three concepts announced are: a sporty crossover; a larger wagon or SUV; and a tall, boxy pod car that looks like a people-mover for cities.’ GM has also announced a fuel-cell-powered heavy-duty truck with two electric motors known as Surus, or ‘silent utility rover universal superstructure.28

In Australia, GM Holden’s engineering centre at its Port Melbourne and Proving Ground at Lang adapt imported vehicles to Australian conditions. Engineering work includes: vehicle structures and dynamics; powertrains; and advanced vehicle development. These facilities are supported by up to 350 jobs.

GM has a handful of EVs including the 2010 plug in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, and the EV Chevrolet Bolt, which was available in the US in August 2017. The Bolt has been a

successful EV for GM, with a 380 km battery range on a single charge and cost of US$37,500 before tax incentives. The range places the vehicle well above the Nissan Leaf with a range of up to 170 km on a single charge, and slightly above Tesla’s Model 3, up to 350 km on a single charge for a standard battery.29

GM’s Global Propulsion System centre has half of GM’s 8,600 designers and engineers involved with alternative and electric propulsion systems.30 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers are specifically working on batteries and EVs.31

GM’s research into batteries is particularly focused on decreasing the amount of cobalt in its new EMC 1.0 battery system (which is a costly component), increasing battery nickel to store and produce more energy efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles, and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells. Cost savings from these changes are expected to be more than 30 per cent, from US$145 per kilowatt-hour to less than US$100 by 2021.32

### Measures to support electric vehicle manufacturing and supply/value chain activities Existing assistance measures and their scope

The Australian Government has a range of measures to assist Australian manufacturing businesses to take full advantage of the uptake of EVs here and globally. The measures include the: Advanced Manufacturing Fund; Growth Fund; Automotive Transformation Scheme; Entrepreneurs’ Programme; Industry Growth Centres Initiative; Cooperative Research Centres program; R&D Tax Incentive; and CSIRO. Other portfolios and agencies also provide assistance measures. For example, CEFC is supporting the purchase of EVs with Macquarie Leasing and the production of Lithium in Western Australia for battery production. CEFC and ARENA are investigating measures to accelerate the uptake of EVs and the requirements for EV charging infrastructure.33

The $30 million Skills and Training Initiative is open until the end of 2018 to help automotive workers find new jobs. Funded by Holden and Toyota, this is primarily assisting their workers, however, Toyota specifically partitioned $3 million of their contribution for workers in its supply chain.

Both Holden and Toyota report that over 80 per cent of their workers have successfully transitioned – either gaining new jobs, studying or retiring. They continue to work with the remaining workers to transition them.

### Automotive Transformation Scheme

The Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) encourages competitive investment, innovation and economic sustainability in the Australian automotive industry.

The ATS will remain in place until December 2020 to assist in the orderly transition of the industry. The ATS has a legislated cap for a particular purpose with expenditure based on eligible activity. Therefore, there is no ‘underspend’ that can be used for other purposes, should the legislated cap not be reached.

Continued access to the ATS for registrants that fail to meet the threshold production requirements can be sought through the ATS national interest provisions. Businesses seeking continued access to the scheme must demonstrate their continued automotive manufacturing activities, and the national benefits that accrue to them.

Businesses that have made a financial commitment to carry on business in Australia as a motor vehicle producer or supplier to the automotive industry, for the first time can also participate in the scheme. Businesses that do not satisfy certain registration requirements may seek the Minister’s permission to apply for registration on national interest grounds.34

## Entrepreneurs Programme The Entrepreneurs Programme provides assistance for building business competitiveness and productivity. The programme offers support to businesses through four elements35:

### Industry Growth Centres Initiative

The Industry Growth Centres Initiative (the Initiative) is an industry-led approach driving innovation, productivity and competitiveness by focusing on areas of competitive strength and strategic priority. This will help Australia transition into smart, high value and export focused industries.

The Initiative enables national action on key issues such as collaboration, commercialisation, international engagement, skills and regulation reform. It drives excellence, not dependence, and will create an economy that ensures Australia’s ongoing prosperity.

Growth Centres are working to lift the levels of collaboration between businesses, industry, research organisations and government to better capitalise on the excellent research and development undertaken and scientific knowledge generated in Australia.

A key activity of each Growth Centre is to set a long-term strategy for its sector in a Sector Competitiveness Plan (SCP). The SCP describes how to lift the capability of the sector, boost productivity and skills, create jobs, reduce red tape and engage with international opportunities.

Growth Centres are helping align industry and innovation policy and programmes, including CSIRO and Cooperative Research Centres, to contribute to improving the productivity, competitiveness and innovative capacity of their sectors.

Of the six Growth Centres, the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC); and the Mining Equipment, Technology and Services Growth Centre (METS Ignited) are best placed to support EVs manufacturing and deployment.

project participants and funding from AMGC is developing a ‘smart factory’ conveyor and digital control system for Tesla’s battery factory in Nevada USA38.

METS Ignited is collaborating with Energetique to build and supply underground mining markets here and overseas with battery EVs.39

### Cooperative Research Centres Program

The Cooperative Research Centres Program supports industry-led collaborations between industry, researchers and the community. It’s a proven model for linking researchers with industry to focus on research and development towards use and commercialisation. 40

For example, the iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) supports the development of a smarter Australian transport system for industries to increase productivity, reduce emissions and remain globally competitive. Its focus includes intelligent transport systems, autonomous vehicles and the flow-on economic and social benefits to Australia.

All levels of government have joined with industry and research organisations to participate in the iMOVE CRC.

The iMOVE CRC aligns with many Government priorities including the Policy Framework for Intelligent Transport Systems, Smart Cities Plan and the National Transport Technology Plan, as well as contributing to other science and research priorities.

### Research and Development Tax Incentive

The Research and Development Tax Incentive is the Government’s key mechanism to stimulate Australian industry investment in R&D. It offers tax offsets for eligible R&D expenditure. 41

## CSIRO, an Australian Government agency responsible for scientific research, has a variety of capabilities that can contribute to the commercialisation of research to support EV manufacturing and energy systems. For example, its research includes high performance batteries, supercapacitors and fuel-cells, some of which has been commercialised42. It has developed a metal membrane to separate hydrogen from ammonia in collaboration with

BOC (part of the Linde Group). The technology has application in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles being developed by Toyota and Hyundai.43

CSIRO is working with businesses, universities, ARENA and the Victorian Government on a range of projects from materials research; battery technologies, production systems, charging systems and control systems; testing, standards and recycling.

### Collaboration with state governments and other stakeholders

The department is experienced in working with other Commonwealth portfolios and agencies, state governments and industry. For example, the Commonwealth Department of Jobs and Small Business, Department of Employment, and Department of Education and Training and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science collaborated with the South Australian and Victorian state governments, Holden and Toyota in developing and delivering the Government’s $155 million Growth Fund. The Fund supported automotive workers in their transition to other careers and supply chain businesses to diversity and invest in new activities.

The Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre one of six Growth Centres in the Industry Growth Centres Initiative is well placed to enable the application of innovative manufacturing technologies associated with EVs. The Initiative enables national action on key issues such as collaboration, commercialisation, international engagement, skills and regulation reform.

The CRC program provides opportunities for Commonwealth and state governments to collaborate with researchers and industry partners to focus research and development on use and commercialisation.

These models or another model agreed between the parties could be used for the two levels of government and other stakeholders to work together in supporting supply and value chain manufacturing and service activities related to EVs.
