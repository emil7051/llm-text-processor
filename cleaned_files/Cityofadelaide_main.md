### Select Committee on Electric Vehicles Committee Secretary Department of the Senate PO Box 6100 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600

## Dear Senators

### RE: SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES

I write to commend the Senate for convening the Select Committee on Electric Vehicles (EVs) and to highlight the significance of this initiative to the liveability and sustainability of Australian cities. I also provide the City of Adelaide’s response to the Terms of Reference.

As you may be aware, there are proven links between pollutants found in vehicle emissions and a range of human health problems (both short and long term). In 2010, the cost of premature deaths due to outdoor air pollution in Australia has been estimated to be up to $7.8 billion. A 2014 report by Victoria's Auditor General, reported there were 1,483 deaths related to air pollution in Australia in 2012. It was estimated that 50 per cent could be attributed to air pollution from road transport.

To keep our cities among the world’s most liveable and prosperous, federal, state and local governments and the business community need to work together to adapt quickly to the challenges and pressures that face us. Major initiatives are required to reduce pollution and pursue deep decarbonisation of our transport system.

The City of Adelaide Strategic Plan 2016-2020 (the Strategic Plan) seeks for Adelaide to be a smart, green, liveable and creative city. To achieve the objective of being one of the world’s first carbon neutral cities and a leader in environmental change, the Strategic Plan commits the Council:

• Work with Federal and State governments to provide appropriate infrastructure and

promote sustainable transport options, such as public transport, cycling and walking, to improve the experience of commuters and reduce transport-related carbon emissions.

• By June 2017, complete a procurement plan for all Council vehicles to be low or

## zero emissions.

• Provide a range of incentives for the use of electric powered and low-emission

### vehicles within the City.

Our Carbon Neutral Strategy 2015-2025 established targets including that the City of Adelaide has zero net carbon emissions by 2025. The Carbon Neutral Adelaide Action Plan 2016-2021 outlines five Carbon Reduction Pathways including Towards Zero Emissions Transport and states that the benefits from decarbonising transport through low and zero emission vehicles will include:

### Electric VehiclesSubmission 93

• noise reduction and local air quality improvements, further enhancing liveability and

### public health outcomes; and

• a shift away from fossil fuels whilst maintaining car accessibility.

An important driver for electric vehicle ownership is the convenience, stability and lower cost of home or destination charging. Recognising this, the City of Adelaide’s Sustainability Incentives Scheme provides financial rebates of up to $1,000 for each fast charger (<20kW) and up to $5,000 for each super-fast charger (>20kW) installed in the city.

To attract more EVs to the city we have installed 40 EV charging stations in our UPark car parks and in on-street locations. This project has enabled South Australian and Australian companies to develop world leading service capabilities and innovative new products.

With the right support, there is a significant opportunity for Australia to grow innovative new businesses in technology, charging infrastructure, shared mobility, and the manufacture and recycling of batteries and componentry. Opportunities for the Australian mining industry to extract and process key resource inputs such as copper, nickel, graphite and lithium must also not be overlooked as the world’s sustainable energy transition accelerates.

### The pillars of this proposal include:

1. a temporary exemption to Fringe Benefits Tax and Luxury Car Tax for 100%

## electric vehicles;

2. a Government fleet target, to enable governments and companies to:

### a. integrate EVs into their fleets; b. support EV uptake through novated leases; and c. provide a flow on benefit to the second-hand market;

3. incentives for charging infrastructure designed to leverage private sector

## investment;

4. Clean Energy Finance Corporation support for battery supply chain activities;
5. transition assistance for the motor trades sector;
6. innovation support for the component manufacturing sector; and 7. a national roadmap for deployment to deliver co-ordinated guidance, standards

## and awareness.

I look forward to continuing to work with you and the Government to support the development of Australia’s innovative, growing and sustainable EV industry.

## Yours sincerely

### Select Committee on Electric Vehicles City of Adelaide Submission – July 2018

The City of Adelaide and South Australia have a long history of innovation and leadership. As one of the world’s five most liveable cities, we have created a smart, green, liveable and creative city for businesses, residents, visitors and students.

As a community, we face unprecedented changes arising from major global, national and local trends. Our proven record of creativity, innovation and social transformation sees our city well placed to lead the state in meeting these changes.

Our plan is to enrich Adelaide’s lifestyle and boost its growth by becoming one of the world’s smartest cities, with a globally connected and opportunity rich economy. We will be one of the world’s first carbon neutral cities and a global leader in sustainability and responding to environmental change.

### City of Adelaide Community Carbon Emissions

The City of Adelaide’s total community carbon emissions have consistently reduced year on year with a 15% overall reduction from the baseline year FY2007 to FY2017. At the same time, the City of Adelaide’s economy grew by 35%1 and residential population grew by 26%.

Unfortunately, total transport related carbon emissions have increased by over 40% from the baseline year FY2007 to FY2017, as shown in Table 1 below.

In 2017, motorised transport contributed approximately 27% of total carbon emissions and it remains entrenched as the second largest carbon emissions source.

• The proportional contribution of transport related GHG emissions to the City of Adelaide community inventory

has increased from 17% in FY2007 (baseline) to 27% in FY2017.

• This increase is largely driven by an increase in private transportation, with a growing number of visitors to the city who are also travelling further to reach the city; as well as an increase in the distance travelled by workers to reach the City of Adelaide.

• The increase in transportation emissions is consistent with the growth that the City of Adelaide has seen

With City visitor numbers increasing and the rapid deployment of renewable energy generation in South Australia, transport emissions are growing in real and proportional terms from 190,551 tonnes in 2007 to 268,887 tonnes in 2017, as shown in Figure 1 below.

This trend must be mitigated or reversed by complementary transport actions to secure enduring reductions in transport emissions.

Analysis of 2015 traffic survey videos, as shown in Table 2, confirms that:

1. passenger cars account for approximately 92.7% of all vehicles using City of Adelaide streets; and
2. changing from internal combustion engines to electric propulsion systems could significantly reduce carbon emissions from city users and improve local air quality without impacting upon commuter transport mode preferences.

## Policy Context

## City of Adelaide

The City of Adelaide Strategic Plan 2016-2020 (the Strategic Plan) seeks for Adelaide to be a smart, green, liveable and creative city. To achieve the objective of being one of the world’s first carbon neutral cities and a leader in environmental change, the Strategic Plan seeks: “To provide a range of incentives for the use of electric-powered and low emission vehicles within the City.” The Carbon Neutral Strategy 2015-2025 (the Strategy) established targets including that the City of Adelaide has zero net carbon emissions by 2025 and outlines priorities including:

### 1. Pursue decarbonisation of the transport system; and
2. Create a supportive environment for early adoption of great

## ideas and technologies.

On 8 November 2016, the Carbon Neutral Adelaide Action Plan 2016- 2021 (the Plan) was jointly released by the CoA and the Government of South Australia. The Plan outlines five Carbon Reduction Pathways including Towards Zero Emissions Transport and states that the benefits from decarbonising transport through low and zero emission vehicles will include:

1. noise reduction and local air quality improvements, further enhancing liveability and public health outcomes; and

2. a shift away from fossil fuels whilst maintaining car accessibility.

Passenger cars account for approximately 92.7% of all vehicles using City of Adelaide streets. Changing from internal combustion engines to electric propulsion systems could significantly reduce carbon emissions from city users and improve local air quality without impacting upon commuter transport mode preferences. The City is committed to decarbonise, not demonise private vehicle use.

## Topic

## Focus Area

## Economic, Environmental and Social Benefits

## Energy Security

Key Point: Transitioning to electric vehicles is a strategic priority action for the City of Adelaide to improve the liveability, sustainability and capture economic opportunities that arise from technological disruption.

The Department of the Environment and Energy’s Australian Energy Update 2017 demonstrates that oil refinery closures and declining domestic oil production, have made Australia increasingly reliant upon imported crude oil and refined petroleum product imports, as shown below.

Given Australia’s reliance upon seaborne oil and refined products and elongated supply chain logistics, a rapid transition to electric vehicles could be prioritised to address Australia’s lack of strategic fuel reserves and mitigate community vulnerability to transport fuel supply disruption8.

The economic benefits of rapidly developing Australia’s renewable energy sector to provide additional electricity for vehicle charging and domestically produced hydrogen for transport could be considered to support national energy security.

Key Point: Electrification of Australia’s vehicle fleet could be considered to maximise domestic energy production and strengthen national energy security.

The City of Adelaide manages over 40,000 on-street parking spaces and 6,101 off-street parking spaces in Council owned and operated UPark public car parks.

To support electric vehicle purchase and to attract more EVs, the City of Adelaide has installed 40 electric vehicle charging stations in four UPark car parks and in four on-street locations. Charging stations comprise thirty-eight 22kW (three phase) AC and two 50kW DC fast chargers (Australian made by Tritium).

The City of Adelaide EV chargers adopted the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries charging standards including Type 2 sockets and a bring your own cable model for AC chargers.

This project has enabled local companies to refine world leading service capabilities and develop innovative new products including:

1. SA Power Networks – 10 on-street EV charging stations with active demand management controls to respond to local electricity distribution network conditions.

2. Nilsen Australia – Construction of 30 off-street electric vehicle

## charging stations.

3. Azzo – Active peak electricity demand management system for 22 EV charging stations embedded in the Adelaide Central Market and Rundle UPark car parks.

### 4. JET Charge – Development of the Chargefox mobile phone

### application and contactless Paywave activation and payment services.

5. Parking Agility – Development of an overhead parking bay

indicator lighting system to match EV parking space availability to actual demand in off-street public car parks to support accelerated infrastructure roll-out.

This project received grant funding from the Government of South Australia, a financial contribution from Mitsubishi Motors Australia and substantial in-kind support from SA Power Networks. Key Point: Governments have a role to lead an early rollout of infrastructure to ensure opportunities generated by global technology disruption are captured by Australian companies to generate new employment and wealth.

Significant private investment, triggered by the Australian Government’s 2020 Renewable Energy Target, has increased electricity generation from renewable sources in South Australia from less than 1% of total electricity demand in 2006-07, to approximately 49% in 2016-17. By 2020-21, it is projected that renewable energy generation in South Australia will reach 73%9. High levels of intermittent renewable generation in the electricity grid are already resulting in extended periods when the National Electricity Market (NEM) in South Australia is over-supplied. This market imbalance in South Australia is reflected in SA Power Networks’ decision to permit electric vehicle charging station/s on a ‘controlled load’ circuit to access a controlled load (‘off peak’) tariff from 1 July 2018. This will reduce electricity costs for charging by approximately 50% and stimulate market demand to support improved NEM pricing during high production periods. As stationary energy and transport are major emission sectors, rapid decarbonisation of Australia’s electricity grid, coupled with a high uptake of electric vehicles scenario, could be an effective strategy to reduce or defer carbon reduction costs for other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, where further technology development may be required.

Key Point: Rapid uptake of electric vehicles will provide additional controlled loads that could assist the Australian Electricity Market Operator to support pricing in the National Electricity Market during periods of high intermittent renewable generation.

## Economic Risk

A failure by Australia to embrace a rapid adoption model for electric vehicles could impair local product and service innovation. Without a rapidly growing domestic market for the development and testing of unique electric vehicle services or products, Australia could lose a generation of automotive sector entrepreneurs to rapid emerging international markets.

## Economic Impact Motor

## Industry Job Losses

## Environmental Benefit

## Carbon emissions reduction

Key Point: An Electric Vehicle Transition Roadmap could be developed that supports rapid adoption, incentivises private investment and innovation to maximise economic opportunities in national and international markets.

In their submission to the Parliament of Victoria, Economy and Infrastructure Committee Inquiry into Electric Vehicles, the Victorian automotive industry stated that a policy framework was required to provide business certainty. The Committee heard that job losses would occur in the servicing and repairs sectors with greater uptake of electric vehicles10. Initiatives could be considered that would support and encourage the Motor Trades sector to transition to electric vehicle sales, servicing and potentially business models, such as car share and mobility as a service, which may result in lower levels of private car ownership. Consideration could be given to industry support, including from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to secure long term battery supply chain activities and enable industry transitions to high skill, technology development for electric and autonomous vehicles. Key Point: An Electric Vehicle Transition Roadmap could be developed that supports industry adjustment and business innovation.

An April 2016 submission to the Australian Government’s Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions, by Renault, Tesla, AGL, TransGrid, and the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association states:

“The transport sector is one of the fastest growing sources of emissions within Australia, increasing by 47.5% since 1990, however it also represents the most financially attractive emission reduction opportunity across the Australian economy.” Total transport related carbon emissions from the City of Adelaide community have increased by over 40% from the baseline year FY2007 to FY2017.

The slow rate of renewal in the light passenger fleet (5-6% per year), growth in Australia’s vehicle fleet, annual freight movements and vehicle kilometres travelled, as well as the absence of major technological leaps in fuel efficiency for new internal combustion engines are significant barriers to the City of Adelaide becoming one of the world’s first carbon neutral cities.

## Environment, Social and Economic Benefits

## Public Health

## Industry Support

## Vehicle Emission Standards

National growth in transport emissions are also a significant threat to the Australian Government’s 2030 international carbon reduction commitment. Without decisive action to accelerate improvements in fuel efficiency and/or the uptake of electric vehicles, additional emissions reduction will need to be secured from other sectors of the economy where there may be greater costs and less co-benefits for the economy and local communities.

Key Point: Public policy, vehicle emissions and fuel standards, as well as an ecosystem of consumer incentives and industry transition support could be prioritised to accelerate technology adoption and private infrastructure investment.

For governments, electrification of transport is being driven globally by the need for improved public health outcomes, zero carbon emission transport, national energy security and community expectations for clean air and liveable cities.

A January 2017 report for the Australian Government’s Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions states that:

1. There are proven links between pollutants found in vehicle

emissions and a range of human health problems (both short and long term).

2. The cost of premature deaths due to outdoor air pollution in Australia in 2010 has been estimated to be up to $7.8 billion.

A 2016 Independent Inquiry into the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, reported that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that in 2010, air pollution associated with road transport in Australia caused 1,483 deaths. In the same year, the national road toll was 1,36711.

Key Point: The public health benefits of a rapid transition to electric vehicles could be significant.

As highlighted by the Australian Government’s Better Fuel for Cleaner Air Discussion Paper: “Automotive fuel is a significant source of noxious emissions. Unless further action is taken to improve the management of vehicle emissions, air quality is likely to decline in the medium to long term. This will adversely impact on the health of Australians.”12 Adoption of vehicle emissions and updated fuel standards will:

## 1.

## 2.

improve air quality, liveability and public health in Australian communities; increase industry certainty about performance requirements in the Australian market, removing the disadvantage for manufacturers importing low and zero emission vehicles. In turn, this could increase consumer choice and quality.

4. prevent manufacturers disposing of stock in Australia that they can no longer sell in other markets where standards prevail. 5. encourage manufacturers to bring forward new model release

### dates to the Australian market.

Key Point: Vehicle emission standards will improve air quality, liveability and public health in Australian communities and provide a clear regulatory and policy framework for industry investment and community uptake of electric vehicles.

A wholistic program of incentives for all electric propulsion vehicles could include motorcycles and e-bikes as:

1. motorcycles and e-bikes are a growing transport mode, being

preferred by an increasing number of commuters and considered a way to beat congestion;

2. zero emission electric models could support achievement of air

### quality and carbon reduction targets; and

3. motorcycles provide an alternative motorised transport option

for city residents and reduce the need for space-intensive onsite car parking, reducing the cost of high-density developments.

Key Point: Incentives could be extended to all forms of electrified transport, including motorcycles and e-bikes.

The Australian Electric Council and NRMA have suggested a government target of 25% for all new light passenger vehicles.13 To support development and importation of new electric vehicle models all levels of Australian government could be supported and encouraged to:

1. purchase electric vehicles to increase national demand to attract

### a greater range of models to the Australian market;

2. demonstrate leadership and raise community awareness of the

## benefits of ownership;

### 3. build publicly accessible recharging infrastructure;
4. generate a supply source for the second-hand market; and 5. provide incentives for purchasers (City of Adelaide’s

### Sustainability Incentives Scheme provides up to $5,000 per installed EV charging station and $250 per electric bicycle charging point)

The City of Adelaide Strategic Plan 2016-2020 required the development of the Zero and Low Carbon Emissions Vehicle Procurement Plan [December 2017]. The Plan will inform future vehicle purchasing and participation in alternative fuel technology pilots so that all Council vehicles, including medium and heavy rigid trucks could transition to electric in the medium term. Key Point: As governments are significant consumers of new vehicles, leadership is required to support and accelerate the industry transition to electric vehicles.

## Incentives Scheme Design

To reflect the rapid rate of technology change and maximise benefits to government and the community, consideration could be given to only providing incentives to 100% electric vehicles. Focussing upon a technology leap to electric propulsion systems, rather than incremental technology changes to internal combustion engines, will:

1. bring forward achievement of emission reduction targets;
2. support higher standards of living;
3. enhance city living; 4. 5. reduced health system costs and premature deaths from

## improve public health;

### respiratory diseases; and

### 6. mitigate climate change adaptation costs.

Key Point: Incentives could target a technology leap from combustion engines (which impact public health) to electric vehicles which deliver multiple co-benefits for communities.

A review of leading cities, including Oslo, Paris, London and Los Angeles, expert advice and other publications indicates that EV charging stations with free EV charging services are highly effective incentives to:

1. Support accelerated community uptake of electric vehicles; and 2. Attract electric vehicle owners to a specific precinct, business or

## car parking facility.

CoA research indicates that where EV charging services have been provided free, there has been a predictable negative driver response when fees were subsequently imposed. Better practice would establish clear community expectations that whilst some level of free charging may be provided initially, fees will progressively increase to achieve cost recovery and eventually a direct return on investment as:

1. electricity consumption costs for EV charging services will be

significant for station hosts once uptake becomes mainstream;

### 2. on-board batteries have up to 100kWh; and
3. the EV charging industry could rapidly evolve as a viable

### alternative to conventional petrol filling stations.

Targeted incentives that do not cause perverse and compounding long term impacts on the efficiency and liveability of cities could be considered. Incentives such as use of priority lanes and free parking, which could trigger long lasting impacts such as transport mode shift to private vehicles, congestion and impaired operation of public transport services, may not be suitable.

Key Point: Publicly owned electric vehicle charging services could be established with a sustainable revenue model to facilitate private investment that will be required to scale up EV charging station networks. Key Point: Incentives that will not impair the efficient operation of city transport systems could be considered.

### Consumer Support Contactless

## Standardisation

## Regulation of Electric Vehicles

(RFID) card or use a mobile phone application to activate charging services. This approach is problematic and inconvenient for many users as they must be registered with multiple networks to use services in different locations. This problem could become worse as more service providers enter the market and may impair consumer choice and competition if commercial operators gain control of several parking facilities in a single location. The City of Adelaide is working with JET Charge to deploy a contactless payment service on EV chargers. Customers will activate and pay for their EV charging services with a debit or credit card, removing the need for a pre-registered RFID card or mobile phone membership. The service will be anonymous and no pre-registration will be required. Key Point: Consideration could be given to EV charging infrastructure incentives being conditional upon standardising the provision of contactless payment options at the charging station.

A review of international programs indicates that tax reform is an effective mechanism to encourage purchase of electric vehicles. Consideration could be given to the following areas of taxation for 100% EVs:

1. Reform of novated lease expense allowances to remove perverse incentives for vehicles to be driven additional kilometres each year.

### 2. Phase out liquid fuel deductions. 3. Temporary relief from stamp duty (point of sale, registration and annual insurance) and registration discounts for electric vehicles.

4. Temporary relief from Fringe Benefits Tax and Luxury Car Tax

### laws to adjust for higher capital cost of electric cars.

Key Point: Encouraging lower fuel and servicing costs could reduce the total cost of novated leases for government and increase demand for electric vehicles. Key Point: A package of temporary tax incentives and reforms could be introduced to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.

The Australian Government’s fuel excise is currently applied as a fixed cost per litre. To support use of higher-quality fuels, consideration could be given to modifying the excise formula to reduce or equalise the price difference between low and high-quality fuels. Revenue could be applied to off-set lost tax revenue from electrification of the Australian vehicle fleet. The use of higher-quality fuels could improve vehicle fuel efficiency, contribute to energy productivity and improve urban air quality. Key Point: A package of temporary tax incentives and reforms could be introduced to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.

The City of Adelaide welcomes the 1 January 2018 inclusion of a requirement in Section 144A and 144B of the Road Traffic (Light Vehicle Standards) Rules 2018 (LVSR) for electric-powered and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) built after 1 January 2019 to be fitted with an identifying label on its front and rear number plates. To support the effective regulation and incentivisation of electric vehicles, the Australian Road Rules (Road Rules) and related legislation

## 10

Topic

could be further updated to include a separate and nationally consistent definition for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Differentiation of these vehicles from conventional hybrid electric (HEV) and FCEVs would enable tailoring of incentives to the specific needs of different vehicle types. For example, differentiation between PHEVs and BEVs, that require an external electricity supply, and HEVs and FCEVs that do not require these services to refuel, would enable targeting of financial and non-financial incentives to the area of greatest need or technology that delivers the greatest community benefit. An example of where this is currently problematic for local government is in the administration of dedicated on-street electric vehicle parking bays. Currently the Road Rules state that a parking control sign could include an electric vehicle parking sign. As neither the Road Rules, nor the LVSR separately define electric vehicles, it could be interpreted that eligible vehicles may also include HEVs or FCEVs, which do not require charging infrastructure. Consequently, the lack of a clear definition could adversely impact on charging station availability, impairing the effectiveness of incentive programs and returns for public and private investors. To support consumer access, improve investment certainty for charging network operators and address dedicated spaces being occupied by conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, Division 5 or 6 of the Road Rules could be amended to include electric vehicle parking bay as a stopping zone for PHEV and EVs. The following example definitions are provided for illustrative purposes;
1. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) means a vehicle, with an on-board energy storage system that can be charged from an external electricity supply, that is powered by 1 or more electric motors or traction motors that are used in conjunction with another propulsion system for the vehicle.

2. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Plug-in electric-powered vehicle means a vehicle, with an energy storage system that can be charged from an external electricity supply, that is powered by 1 or more electric motors or traction motors that are the only propulsion system for the vehicle.

Key Point: The Australian Road Rules and related legislation could be updated to provide nationally consistent definitions for the four different types of electric vehicles to support effective regulation and targeted incentives programs.

## Standardisation

## Charging Standards

The City of Adelaide supports adoption of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries proposed EV charging standards:

1. AC Charging – IEC 62196-2 Configuration Type 2 socket; and 2. DC Charging – Both IEC 62196-3 Configuration FF (CCS-2) with tethered cable and IEC 62196-3 Configuration AA (CHAdeMO).

Adopting these standards will harmonise the national charging network, enabling government and industry to invest in inter-operable charging infrastructure. Key Point: The City of Adelaide has implemented the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries proposed EV charging standards for its charging stations.

## 11

## Connection Point Location on Vehicles

## Environment

## Measuring Carbon Reduction Benefits

## Consumer Protection

## Vehicle Emissions Testing

Currently the automotive manufacturing industry does not have a standardised approach for the location of the charging port on EVs. This may be a barrier to a large scale private sector rollout of EV charging station infrastructure. The location of the charging ports currently vary from the right rear side, to the left rear side or the front on popular models. This materially complicates the design of charging infrastructure and renders many prominent and convenient on-street parking bays as unacceptable as perceived safety risks (such as proximity to carriageways, trip hazards and vehicle/pedestrian circulation) cannot be mitigated. There is a need to standardise the location of charging ports on EVs to ensure that current Australian parking standards remain adequate for the operational needs of vehicles and the safe circulation of pedestrians. Key Point: Consideration could be given to the standardisation of the charging port location at the front of vehicles to support safer and cost efficient provision of EV charging infrastructure.

Current Scope 2 and 3 emissions factors for the consumption of purchased electricity by end users (National Greenhouse Accounts Factors) could be viewed as inaccurate for modelling the carbon intensity of future electricity used for charging electric vehicles markets. These emission factors are based upon a historical three year rolling average of annual generation that is a year behind the publishing date (i.e. latest estimate factors released in July 2017 are based upon FY2013/14, FY2014/15, FY2015/16 data)14. To improve modelling accuracy, current FY (not a three year rolling average) and projected emissions factors could be used that draw upon information for renewable energy projects that are well documented by the Australian Government and the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO). To further enhance comparison, consideration could also be given to inclusions and exclusions in the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors lifecycle assessment of Scope 3 emissions from liquid fuel production. This will ensure all energy use and fugitive emissions from extraction and refinement of liquid fuels is reflected in final modelling. Key Point: Projected emissions factors for electricity could be used to improve the accuracy of modelled benefits from electric vehicles. Key Point: Further information is required to ensure National Greenhouse Accounts Factors for Scope 3 emissions from liquid fuel production include all energy use and fugitive emissions from extraction and refinement of liquid fuels.

To protect consumers and ensure standards effectively and efficiently contribute to Government carbon reduction initiatives, Australian vehicle regulations could require manufacturers to demonstrate that their vehicle emissions meet standards in an on-road setting. Key Point: Australian vehicle regulations could require manufacturers to demonstrate that their vehicle emissions meet standards in an on-road setting.
