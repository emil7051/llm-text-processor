### Electric VehiclesSubmission 130

## Background

The South Australian Government recognises that the developed world is on the cusp of a major transition in the form of its transport fleets. While the projected timeframe varies, it seems likely there will be 15-20 year transition from about 2020 onwards from fleets mostly powered by fossil- fuelled internal combustion engines to fleets mostly propelled by electric motors drawing energy from battery storage, hydrogen fuel cell stacks or other roadside infrastructure.

Electrification is widely recognised as a global transport technology megatrend, along with autonomous technology, connectivity enabled by information technologies (intelligent transport systems) and shared mobility (Mobility as a Service). Nearly all major auto manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of new EV models that are expected to come to market from 2020 onwards and become fully cost competitive with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by about 2025. Several countries/cities have already stated their intention to phase out ICE vehicles altogether and some major automotive manufactures have stated plans for a fully electrified fleet (eg Volvo).

While many countries have implemented policies to encourage their emerging EV sectors, a coordinated and supportive policy approach is still developing in Australia. Consequently, the local penetration of plug-in EVs is currently very low with <0.1% of new car sales compared to 2.6% in the UK, 6.4% in the Netherlands and 28.8% in Norway. The benefit of introducing a comprehensive national EV policy has been recently demonstrated in New Zealand where their May 2016 EV Programme has driven a 6-fold increase in EVs on road in just two years from approximately 1,350 to 8,000.

Australia has had a slow start in the transition to EVs, however it seems inevitable that the same global trends and responses will be repeated here, particularly once EVs are readily available and cost competitive in the Australian marketplace. While the market share of EVs in Australia is currently a nominal 0.1%, it is predicted to reach between 20% and 30% by 2030.

The transition to EVs will cause significant disruption to many existing industries, globally and in Australia, but will provide for substantial new development opportunities in many industries across the battery value chain; to the hydrogen economy; and through the manufacture of EVs and related infrastructure and support services. In Australia, it will require the large-scale deployment of recharging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, and the electricity sector will be impacted by increased demand, the potential for distributed storage and through integration of EVs into ‘smart home’ energy management systems.

The South Australian Government believes that Australia should plan for an orderly transition to EVs to maximise the benefits and minimise costs to consumers and businesses, and at the same time, maximise the research, industry development and employment opportunities as a result of the transition. These outcomes are unlikely to be maximised unless actively supported.

Importantly, the South Australian Government seeks to participate in a coordinated national response to EVs between the Commonwealth Government, states and territories. It is unlikely that any state operating in isolation can adequately influence the national vehicle market and the decisions of international EV manufacturers and technology suppliers. There is also a risk that, in the absence of national coordination, ad hoc incompatible EV charging networks will develop. Development of national charging standards would avoid another “rail-gauges” risk.

Australia has a highly connected national road network, and strategic planning of road infrastructure needs to consider the imminent need for a national electric highway with extensive, publicly accessible charging infrastructure, to avoid sections of the community being left behind, such as regional areas that could be less attractive for commercial charging operators.

The transition to EVs will have implications for already declining fuel excise revenues and could increase debate on national road pricing and road funding reform. While revenue is already declining due to slow fleet growth and more efficient vehicles, a future pricing model should not impose excessive costs on EVs that suppresses their take up.

A well-led national response may require a new national policy structure, for example the UK Office for Low Emission Vehicles that sits across the Transport and Energy/Industry portfolios, and the better use and coordination of existing COAG-related transport, energy and environment groups, for example the Transport and Infrastructure Council (TIC) and Transport and Infrastructure Senior Officials Committee (TISOC). If so, then any group should consider the inter- relationships with wider future mobility disruptors including autonomous vehicles.

An important decision for all Australian Governments is whether to invest public funds to encourage the early uptake of EVs (both privately and in public fleets) and to provide support for initial charging/refuelling infrastructure as a means to meaningfully accelerate this transition, as has been the case in many developed countries. While Australia could simply wait for a market response for its transition to EVs, it is important to look at the international trends. The anticipated economic, social and environmental benefits of the transition to EVs will be subject to risk or delay if there is poor preparation for the impacts of EVs on Australia’s electricity supplies, delayed deployment of appropriate charging infrastructure and lost industry development opportunities in the absence of a strong local market for EVs.

A recent report titled Recharging the Economy - Economic impact of accelerating EV adoption prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and launched by the then Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, quantified a net positive economic benefit to 2030 should Australia adopt a strong EV policy approach similar to Norway. Further economic analysis is now needed to determine the optimum level of public investment in EVs for Australia, including subsidies, infrastructure, and taxation and industry policies.

## Discussion

In making our submission we highlight the following matters to the Select Committee pertinent to South Australia:

### Competitive advantages of the South Australian economy

The high incidence of wind and increasingly solar energy in the South Australian energy supply, currently in excess of 50% of electricity generation in the state and projected to exceed 70% by 2021, provides a significant point of difference to other jurisdictions. Consequently, the uptake of EVs, when displacing ICE vehicles, provides for significant immediate reductions in GHG emissions. This has proved attractive to auto manufacturers in showcasing their EVs and FCEVs in South Australia and to organisations such as EVenergi/ARENA in conducting EV uptake programs in South Australia.

As a result of our differing energy mix, South Australia is well placed to look at the opportunities from flexible time-of-day charging of a large EV fleet differently to other states, to take advantage of periods of high wind and solar supply.

South Australia is investing significant resources in energy storage. This includes the establishment of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) based on home solar PV, Tesla battery storage and smart meters to allow the controlled flow of electricity to and from the grid, with central management of the distributed energy resource (DER).

South Australia has also recently announced the Home Battery Scheme to be launched in October 2018. This scheme will provide $100 million towards the installation of battery storage systems in 40,000 homes. This world leading scheme will support the installation of batteries that are able to be incorporated into a VPP to further support our energy network.

EVs which generally have much larger batteries than those used for home storage have the potential to significantly add to the state’s DER capacity; consequently, South Australia is interested in trialling vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies as is currently the case in the UK (Nissan trial).

An increase of EVs on our roads, as would be achieved by a broad national policy in support of early uptake, will facilitate our early learning of grid impacts and storage opportunities.

The state also retains an automotive sector following the closure of Holden with many component suppliers, a strong research base and a remnant pool of skilled workers. If the transition to EVs both overseas and in Australia proves strong, the local availability of EVs may be limited by supply. There are also opportunities for niche EVs and FCEVs specific to local or regional needs such as buses, trucks, airport AEVs and mining vehicles. We understand that EVs with relatively few components can be built cost-competitively at a much smaller manufacturing scale than is the case for conventional light passenger vehicles. While future EV manufacturing in South Australia would need to be privately-led, investment decisions are likely to be facilitated by national EV policy providing support for domestic uptake.

### Alignment with Other Major Transport Disruptors

There are close alignments between EV manufacturers and autonomous vehicle development, with an expectation that all future autonomous vehicles (AV) will be electric. The take up of electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) will also bring safety and traffic efficiency benefits across all modes (car, bus and rail) of our transport network.

South Australia has taken a strong leadership approach to establish a presence in the emerging EAV industry by being the first state to enact legislation to conduct on-road autonomous vehicle trials and establishing a $10 million Future Mobility Lab Fund to support projects that demonstrate, develop, or contribute to the applied research and implementation of future mobility technology. South Australia is conducting more trials of EAV platforms than any other jurisdiction.

South Australia is establishing itself as a test bed for innovation in transport. The EAV ecosystem developed in South Australia includes Aurrigo (UK), EasyMile (France), Local Motors (USA), Navya (France) with strong interest in EV manufacturing from Sweden and UK. Our EAV ecosystem is providing the opportunity to create new jobs to support this growing base and to attract new industry players.

As an example, the South Australian Government recently signed an MOU with French autonomous mobility technology company EasyMile to establish their Asia Pacific Corporate Headquarters in Adelaide and to partner with Transit Australia group, who will establish the Australia and New Zealand Operations and support centre for autonomous vehicles in Adelaide in 2018. Further to this, EasyMile autonomous shuttle busses will be manufactured in Adelaide in partnership with existing South Australian manufacturers for the APAC domestic and export markets.

The South Australian Government recommends that the Select Committee note the anticipated global megatrend toward EAVs that is likely to see short-range or neighbourhood electrified autonomous public transport and on-demand mobility as a service (MaaS), connecting to high capacity transit services, which could greatly reduce the need for private vehicle ownership.

As non-conventional vehicles, driverless vehicles face a range of barriers with existing ADR classifications and standards, with many falling into the classification for luxury vehicle tax. This is a significant barrier to the importation of EAVs, particularly in early research and testing phases. The Transport and Infrastructure Council (TIC) and Transport and Infrastructure Senior Officials Committee (TISOC) are progressing these matters at a national level and may provide a working model for wider EV policy development.

## Heavy Vehicles

South Australia caters for over 53,000 freight and commercial trips on the road network every day. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has forecast that the total road freight transported across Australia could reach almost 400 billion tonne kilometres by 2030, almost doubling current volumes. Industry relies heavily upon effective and reliable road freight

transport, and there is a growing trend for heavy vehicles to accommodate greater mass and dimensions.

The South Australian Government recommends that the Select Committee consider the potential for electric heavy vehicle uptake (both battery and hydrogen fuel cell). In the case of battery electric heavy vehicles, this presents challenges for charging infrastructure given the longer-haul and time critical nature of the industry but could also present opportunities in relation to driver fatigue regulations.

### Deployment of Charging Infrastructure

The South Australian Government has partnered with local governments, universities and the private sector to deploy charging infrastructure in the city-centre, at Tonsley and for e-tourism purposes across the rural Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island. This has seen 50kW DC Fast Charging infrastructure provided in the city and planned for the Tonsley Innovation District. It has also seen 30+ 22kW Type 2 AC charging stations provided on-street and in city car parks and planned for Tonsley. Low cost Type 1 AC charging has been provided in rural areas. These services have provided support to early adopters in the private and commercial use of their EVs.

The Government is regularly approached by private businesses, ranging from major corporations to small traders, interested in establishing charging infrastructure for their clients and customers or as a profit making enterprise preparing for future customer needs. While some have proceeded, others are deterred by high installation costs and the lack of EVs on the road to date. A national EV policy that describes an EV future for Australia, including planning and seed funding for charging infrastructure could liberate substantial private investment in new charging infrastructure.

### Vehicle Charging Standards

In the deployment of charging infrastructure since 2017/18, the South Australian Government has encouraged the deployment of 50A CCS-2 DC Fast Charging and 22kW Type-2 (Mennekes) plug standards on all charging infrastructure supported by public funding, consistent with the emerging national standard advocated by the many motor vehicle manufacturers. However there remains uncertainty, due to a desire to cater for some current and most past EVs that employ CHAdeMO and CCS Type-1 DC Fast charging and Type-1 (J1772) AC charging.

A single mandated national plug and vehicle charging standard for EVs is encouraged to remove this uncertainty and to ensure that all future EVs will be able to charge at any charging point without the need for a variety of adapters and cables. Restricting public investment or other incentives (eg rapid depreciation allowances) to charging infrastructure that meets the standard will help ensure conformity.

 for hydrogen FCEV there is a single international standard for the hydrogen refuelling port, applicable to all classes of FCEV vehicles (ie cars, buses and trucks), enabling universal access to the refuelling network.

### Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles

The South Australian Government recognises the opportunity to become a producer, consumer and exporter of clean hydrogen, and in doing so create jobs, grow exports and support the state’s energy transition. The state is currently co-investing with industry to establish clean hydrogen production facilities in South Australia, which provides a near term opportunity to demonstrate the use of hydrogen as a domestic transport fuel.

Australia’s hydrogen opportunity is gaining recognition at the national level, with the recent release of a briefing paper to COAG Energy Ministers by Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel, and a subsequent request for a proposal to develop a national hydrogen strategy. The paper was informed by CSIRO’s National Hydrogen Roadmap and an ARENA commissioned report into opportunities for Australia from hydrogen exports, both released in August.

The South Australian Government recommends that the Select Committee include a full consideration of hydrogen FCEVs in addition to battery EVs. The economic and industry development opportunities identified for battery EVs will equally apply to FCEVs, and particularly if FCEVs prove to be a better solution for certain needs such as buses, municipal heavy vehicles and long-range haulage vehicles that are more likely to be manufactured domestically than are passenger cars.

### Leadership through the Government Fleet (Fleet SA)

The South Australian Government has set and plans to achieve a target of 30% Low Emission Vehicles in its fleet by 2019. It is currently ahead of target at 26%. While this will likely be met with vehicles such as Toyota and Hyundai Hybrids, it has included the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and Fleet SA has an advance order of ten Tesla Model 3.

Fleet SA will continue to trial EVs, and in future FCEVs, as they become available in preparation for the future transition of corporate fleets to EVs. The ability to do so would be markedly improved by the availability of a greater number of fleet suitable EVs across a wider range of vehicle classes in the Australian market place, noting that most currently available plug-in vehicles are from luxury brands costing well in excess of $100,000 and there are few commercial EVs. Operation of EVs in government fleets would also benefit greatly from the provision of public charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure to expand their viable range of operation.

Forward-minded government fleets across Australia would benefit from a national policy that promotes the availability, affordability and infrastructure support for EVs in Australia, and in turn would be able to significantly contribute to the implementation of such a policy through the early uptake and demonstrated use of these vehicles.

### Contribution to State Environmental Policy

The Climate Change and Greenhouse Emissions Reduction Act 2007 recognises the importance of aligning our state-based policy responses with national and international climate change policy.

## 7

Transport related emissions comprise approximately 20%1 of the state’s emissions and unlike other sectors of the economy are rising with increasing wealth and population growth. With the majority of emissions (approx. 14%2) arising from light motor vehicles, the transition to zero emission EVs will be important to achieving the target laid out in that legislation.

There are likely to be significant additional environmental benefits in addition to GHG emission reductions with the transition to EVs. This will include improvements in air quality and reduction in noise leading to improved human health and wellbeing outcomes in urban environments. These are matters of growing importance as our major cities increase in both population and urban density. Reductions will also occur in the release of pollution to waterways due to reduced leakage of fuel and oil into roadside drainage systems and the accumulation of particulate matter.

Conversely there may be future impacts such as the need to manage redundant infrastructure with associated pollution concerns (service stations, manufacturing/processing and fuel storage facilities) and second life and recycling of batteries and fuel cells.

### 1 2016 emissions for SA: 26,418.69 All Transport: 6,583.92 = 24.9% 2 2016 emissions: All transport: 6,583.92 Cars: 3,101.06 = 47.1% of transport emissions from cars.
