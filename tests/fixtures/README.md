# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures for the various unit and integration tests.

## HTML Fixtures
The HTML fixtures in the `html/` directory were consolidated from the previous `test_html_files` directory in the project root. These files are used to test HTML parsing and conversion functionality.

## Sample Text Files
Sample text files and various formats can be found in examples/sample_data.

## Note on External Test Data
Previously, the project had test documents in `/Users/ed/dev/text-cleaning/test_docs` and processed outputs in `/Users/ed/dev/text-cleaning/processed_files`. For production use, it's recommended to use the fixtures within this test directory structure to ensure consistency and portability of tests.
