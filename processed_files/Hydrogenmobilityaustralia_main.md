### About Hydrogen Mobility Australia

Hydrogen is being recognised globally as having the potential to play a significant role in a future
sustainable energy system as a highly versatile energy carrier. The realisation of a hydrogen society
built around this clean energy represents a solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the
world’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Hydrogen Mobility Australia (HMA) is a membership-based industry association with a mission to
realise a hydrogen society for Australia. Our members comprise vehicle manufacturers, energy
companies and infrastructure providers with interests across the hydrogen value chain, including
hydrogen production, storage, export, power-to-gas, distribution and mobility, and who recognise the
significant opportunity the economy-wide application of hydrogen presents for Australia.

As a hydrogen advocate, HMA’s objective is to support the growth of this new energy sector in
Australia by specifically:

• Accelerating the commercialisation of new hydrogen and fuel cell technologies by engaging

with governments to create a conductive policy and regulatory environment

• Providing a forum for effective communication and collaboration of all stakeholders in the

hydrogen and energy community across the public and private sectors

• Progressing Australia’s shift towards a future hydrogen society built upon clean and

renewable energy technologies through advocacy and education exploiting the expertise,
know-how and commercial drive of the HMA members

From a mobility perspective, HMA and its members are focussed on the introduction of fuel cell
electric vehicles (FCEVs) from passenger vehicles and forklifts to semi-trailers and trains to Australia
and the establishment of nationwide hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. Our key initiatives pertaining
to this are:

• Facilitating demonstration and commercial hydrogen refuelling infrastructure deployment to

### develop a country wide refuelling station network

• Supporting the large-scale introduction of FCEVs to Australia and measures to encourage

## their uptake

• Expediting the adoption of internationally recognised regulations, codes and standards for

### infrastructure and vehicles through harmonisation

• Delivering hydrogen education and thought leadership on Australia’s opportunity to develop a

### domestic and export hydrogen sector

HMA’s organisational structure also includes a government observer group in recognition of the
importance of public-private collaboration for the development of this sector. Membership of this
group includes the Department of Energy and the Environment, Australian Renewable Energy
Agency, New South Wales Government, South Australian Government and Victorian Government.

## Executive Summary

Hydrogen Mobility Australia (HMA) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Select Committee
into Electric Vehicles. The Inquiry is a timely initiative given the transformations happening in the
automotive sector globally and the opportunity for Australia to take advantage of the environmental,
economic and social benefits this transition will inevitably deliver.

HMA participates in this inquiry as a representative of organisations with interests in hydrogen fuel
cell electric vehicles otherwise known as FCEVs. As the name implies, an FCEV is an electric
vehicle. However, unlike a battery electric vehicle (BEV), which stores its electricity in a battery, an
FCEV produces its own electricity on-board and on-demand in a fuel cell.

With Australia’s comparative advantages in renewable energies combined with automotive expertise
from ongoing R&D post local manufacturing, we are well placed to optimise the electric revolution
taking place in the transport sector. From a hydrogen perspective, the opportunity is even more
significant. Australia is well positioned be a major supplier of hydrogen to the world presenting
opportunities for economies of scale in hydrogen production and in turn benefits for the mobility
sector. It therefore makes sense to develop a domestic sector based on hydrogen, including fuel cell
electric mobility. Governments have a key role to play in this and HMA looks forward to working with
all stakeholders to achieve this outcome.

Our submission makes several recommendations for governments at all levels to meet Australia’s
climate, energy and economic goals. Overarching these suggested measures, a national framework
is required to provide certainty for industry to invest and dedicate resources to Australia. It is our
suggestion that due to the potential importance of this new sector and the need for extensive
coordination across governments, a dedicated office comprised of representatives from the relevant
federal government departments is established for this purpose.

In relation to specific supportive measures for zero emission vehicles and infrastructure, the five key
areas we believe require government focus are outlined below:

### Vehicle incentive measures:

### • Development of a national zero emission vehicle strategy
• Establishment of a package of financial and non-financial measures (until vehicle purchase

## •

### price parity is achieved)
Introduction of a light vehicle CO₂ emission standard (which we note is currently under
development however implementation timing is unclear)

### Private and public fleet procurement policies:

Introduction of zero emission vehicle targets for government fleets

## •
• Government support for private fleets to integrate zero emission vehicles

### Infrastructure support measures:

• Development of a national infrastructure plan for hydrogen refuelling infrastructure
• Establishment of public-private partnerships for infrastructure deployment

### Consistent regulations, codes and standards:

• Adoption and harmonisation of internationally recognised and consistent regulations, codes

### and standards for vehicles and infrastructure

### Information and education:

• Government delivery of targeted education campaigns in collaboration with industry
• Government support for demonstration and trials

## 4

From an FCEV perspective, a critical mass of vehicles across transport segments combined with
refuelling infrastructure is needed to stimulate the initial growth of the sector. Governments can play
a key role in creating an environment to enable this foundation to be built.

Finally, it should be reiterated that the position of HMA and its members is that both battery and fuel
cell electric technologies have a key role to play in decarbonising the transport sector. Any discussion
pitching one clean technology against another limits the world’s ability to achieve meaningful
emission reductions. We refer to these technologies as ‘zero emission vehicles’ or ZEVs rather than
‘electric vehicles’ to make this clear.

Ultimately the uptake of each vehicle technology will be driven by three things: (1) consumer
preference/choice; (2) specific application areas i.e. freight transport and (3) government
regulation. HMA therefore encourages governments to establish a conducive policy and regulatory
environment so that these exciting technologies can flourish where best fit for market.

### About hydrogen and fuel cell electric vehicles

## Properties of hydrogen is the lightest element, makes up 75 per cent of the universe and can be produced using a
variety of primary energy sources. Like electricity, hydrogen is an energy carrier and not an energy
source. It is an environmentally friendly fuel that, if made from renewable energy, emits no
greenhouse or noxious emissions and does not contribute to global warming.

Hydrogen is not found in pure form on earth but must be separated from other compounds such as
water, natural gas or biomass. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas or
renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, tidal, wave and biomass to make electricity that can
then be used in an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. It can then be stored in vast
amounts and readily converted back to electricity as needed.

As with all types of fuels, care is required when handling hydrogen. Hydrogen gas has unique
properties but can be used as safely as other common fuels when simple guidelines are followed.1
As hydrogen has a low density, it tends not to mix with air and disperses upwards, which means that
the concentration levels necessary for ignition or detonation are unlikely to be achieved. This gives
hydrogen a comparative advantage to other fuels from a safety perspective. LPG for instance is
approximately twice as heavy as air when in gas form and will tend to sink to the lowest possible
level and may accumulate in cellars, pits or drains.

## Hydrogen production

As noted above hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of fossil fuel and renewable energy
sources. Hydrogen energy value chains can therefore readily adapt to changes in the nation’s mix of
energy sources.

Hydrogen production using renewable electricity is growing rapidly. Most commonly, electricity from
renewable sources such as wind or solar power is used to drive the electrochemical dissociation
(electrolysis) of water to form hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction is also known as water splitting.
The reaction occurs in a device known as an electrolyser, which consists of a positive electrode
(anode) and negative electrode (cathode) separated by an electrolyte or a membrane.

When an electrical potential is applied between the electrodes, hydrogen is formed at the cathode
and oxygen at the anode, with the hydrogen collected for use. The oxygen may also be collected if
there is market demand, but for large‐scale hydrogen production the quantity produced will greatly
exceed demand and so will be released into the atmosphere.

## Hydrogen applications

Hydrogen is already produced in Australia for industrial applications in the chemical, power
generation, glass, food ammonia and other industries and is safely transported across the country
usually in cylinders or tube trailers. However, with hydrogen increasingly being recognised as a clean
fuel that could mitigate the impacts of global warming, it has been identified as having the potential to
play seven key roles in the world’s energy transition2:

• Enabling large-scale renewable energy integration and power generation • Distributing energy across sectors and regions
• Acting as a buffer to increase energy system resilience

### • Decarbonising industrial energy use
• Helping to decarbonise building heat and power • Providing clean feedstock for industry
• Decarbonising transportation

Together these applications are expected to create significant benefits for the energy system, the
environment and the global economy. Several countries and regions have announced their intent to
incorporate hydrogen into their energy mix in recognition of these benefits, including the EU, China,
Japan and South Korea.

With its comparative advantage in natural resources, Australia has an opportunity to be a source of
this hydrogen and develop a new export sector based on clean energy.

### Hydrogen in transportation

Hydrogen as a transport fuel is being adopted in several countries, including Japan, South Korea and
the UK as a solution to the decarbonisation of the sector. Hydrogen fuelled FCEV’s are increasingly
recognised by governments and industry as a complement to BEVs to achieve meaningful emissions
reductions. The availability of two alternative technologies also reduces the dependency upon one
energy source.

As the name implies, an FCEV is an electric vehicle. However, unlike a BEV, which stores its
electricity in a battery, an FCEV produces its own electricity on-board and on-demand in a fuel cell.
Within the fuel cell, a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates electricity which in
turn powers an electric drive train. The only by-products of this process are water and heat with no
CO₂ or noxious emissions.

FCEVs incorporate a battery to capture the energy of regenerative braking and use this electricity to
supplement the fuel cell. However, FCEV batteries (which are smaller and lighter than those within a
BEV) are not externally charged like a BEV; there’s no need to plug it in. Due to this, the overall mass
and load bearing capacity of an FCEV is generally more favourable than an EV due to the absence of
large batteries. Further, drawbacks associated with battery recycling are also reduced.

FCEVs have all the advantages of an electric drivetrain: clean, smooth, quiet and around 2x - 2.5x
more efficient than an internal combustion engine (ICE) with the benefits of today’s vehicles,
including fast refuelling times (3-5 minutes) and long travel range (currently up to 800km).

Specific areas where FCEVs are expected to play a key role in future transport fleets include:

• Heavy and light commercial vehicles – Application of fuel cell technology in these segments

can maintain, if not improve power to weight ratios compared to ICE and BEV while delivering
range, quick refuelling times, use of waste heat and virtually no engine noise

• Public and private fleets – Fast refuelling benefits commercial fleets and other vehicles in

## near-continuous use

• Autonomous vehicles – FCEVs are tipped to be more suitable for autonomous vehicles due
to their ability to provide the energy needed to process significant amounts of data. The
advent of autonomy will also lead to the establishment of new vehicle usership and
ownership models which will also benefit from the minimal downtime offered by FCEVs

In relation to current activity and growth areas for the application of fuel cell technology across
transport segments, considerable growth is being seen across several areas such as:

## 7

## • Passenger vehicles:

### o Approximately 6,500 vehicles sold worldwide
o Honda Clarity, Hyundai ix35 and Toyota Mirai available for sale now in parts of Asia,

## the EU and the US

o Hyundai Nexo, the company’s second-generation FCEV available for sale in Australia

## by early 2019

## • Buses:

o One of the most mature fuel cell technologies with an operating performance comparable to diesel and CNG buses, and no extra curb weight to maximise
passenger capacity

o Fleets operating throughout Europe, the UK, Asia and the US supporting city

### emission reduction objectives

o EU fleets alone have travelled almost 10 million kilometres and refuelled with more

### than 1.1 million kilograms of hydrogen3

## • Trucks:

o Recognised as one of the biggest opportunities for the application of fuel cells due to

### load carrying requirements

o US company, Nikola Motors to launch fuel cell semi-truck in 2020 with a 20-minute

### refuelling time and 800–1600km range dependent on load

o Toyota’s Project Portal concept semi-truck currently demonstrating scaleability of
Mirai fuel cells and transporting goods at the Port of Long Beach, California

## • Forklifts:

o Fuel cell forklifts adopted by leading companies including Amazon, Walmart and

IKEA due to total cost of ownership benefits, including minimal down time

o Over 12 million forklift refuellings reached in the US in 20184 o First fuel cell forklift launched in Australia in April 2018 by US manufacturer, Hyster-

## Yale

## • Trains:

o Hydrogen’s application to trains is being viewed as a direct replacement for diesel

### and requiring less infrastructure investment than electric

o French company Alstom tested the first fuel cell train in Germany in 2017 and has
announced plans to introduce the trains to the UK to support the government’s ambitions to remove all diesel rolling stock by 2040

Again, we note that HMA’s position is that both battery and fuel cell electric technologies have an
important role to play in decarbonising the transport sector. Any discussion pitching one
clean technology against another limits the world’s ability to achieve meaningful emission reductions.
This position is consistent with the McKinsey Center for Mobility:

Hydrogen and batteries are often portrayed as competing technologies, and batteries have
received a lot of attention in recent years (“proton versus electron”). The relative strengths
and weaknesses of these technologies, however, suggest that they should play complementary roles. Battery electric vehicles exhibit higher overall fuel efficiency as long as
they are not too heavy due to large battery sizes, making them ideally suited for short-

distance and light vehicles. Hydrogen can store more energy in less weight, making fuel cells
suitable for vehicles with heavy payloads and long ranges.5

### Hydrogen refuelling infrastructure

Hydrogen refuelling stations can be integrated into the forecourt of petrol stations adjacent to other
fuel bowsers or alternatively can be built on site at the premises of fleet operators for the purposes of
back to base refuelling. The hydrogen itself can either be generated on site through electrolysis or
delivered via tube trailer or gas pipelines.

There are currently nearly 300 private and public hydrogen refuelling stations globally, but no
commercial stations in Australia at this stage, however this is expected to change in the next 18
months with projects in the ACT and Victoria currently in progress. Both Toyota and Hyundai also
have their own hydrogen refuelling stations to service their vehicles in Australia.

Globally, many countries have already announced they will build some 2,800 hydrogen
refuelling stations by 2025, which would be sufficient to cover the leading markets for hydrogen
vehicles. Germany for instance is aiming for 400 stations by 2023, and California and Japan are
targeting 200 and 320 stations respectively by 2025.

Hydrogen refuelling is still an early, developing market however scaling up infrastructure deployment
will bring station costs down. The costs for building a midsize station in Germany has already
reduced by 50 per cent compared to five years ago, but further decreases are needed to support the
rollout into the mass market.6

A report by the California Energy Commission and the California Air Resources Board into the time
and cost needed to attain 100 hydrogen refuelling stations in California found that station costs are
expected to begin declining around 2020 and could decrease by 50 per cent in 2025 due to
increased worldwide demand.7 With scale, the Hydrogen Council estimates that infrastructure costs
of less than $1,000 per FCEV are possible.8

### Economic, environmental and social benefits of electric
vehicles

Zero emission vehicles offer a wide range of benefits to communities including reduced emissions,
noise, air quality improvements and the potential for lower operating costs. They also provide
opportunities for the introduction of new technologies, employment creation and investment
attraction. These benefits are being recognised by governments across the world who are facilitating
the entry of these technologies through establishing conducive policy, regulatory and financially
incentivised business environments.

Australia’s traditional positioning as a vehicle technology taker due to the size of our marketplace
relative to other nations indicates that from trends in ZEV support and forecast uptake elsewhere, the
future of automotive in our country is likely to be increasingly electric – be it hydrogen fuel cell or
battery. If this positioning it to change, it is contingent upon all levels of government to maximise the
broader opportunities and benefits associated with this transition, a summary of which are presented
below.

## Environmental benefits

The environmental benefits of ZEVs are widely acknowledged and at a high level consist of:
• Reduced transport sector CO₂ emissions (the only emission from an FCEV is water)
• Air quality improvements (FCEVs emit no noxious emissions) • Reduced noise pollution (FECVs are quieter than their ICE counterparts particularly for heavy

## vehicles)

• Decreased reliance on fossil fuels (FCEVs run on hydrogen which can be cleanly produced

### from sunlight or wind and water)

It should also be noted that hydrogen, as an energy carrier, presents many broader environmental
benefits beyond decarbonising mobility. The Hydrogen Council, a global initiative of leading energy,
transport and industry companies predicts that by 2050, hydrogen could meet 18 per cent of the
world’s energy demands and avoid 6 Gt of CO₂ emissions or 20 per cent of CO₂ emission reduction
targets by 2050.9

## Economic benefits

### Similarly, the economic benefits of ZEVs include:

### Improved diversity in the energy mix

• Development of a new industry sector based on clean technologies, and associated

### employment creation and investment attraction
Investments in the ramp-up of infrastructure and manufacturing would create additional
revenues and jobs in existing sectors, mostly in construction and machinery

• For individual consumers, reduced maintenance costs: no oil & filter to change or dispose of,

reduced break wear and fewer moving parts in a ZEV versus their ICE counterparts

FCEVs specifically, in their role as a complementary technology to BEVs, can reduce reliance upon
the electricity grid through the use of hydrogen generated from excess renewables or off-peak power,
thereby reducing necessity for grid upgrades to accommodate growing BEV uptake. Hydrogen can
also be used to store excess renewable energy, therefore optimising renewable energy capture and
use, thereby having a positive impact on energy costs and business case for investments in these
assets.

## 9 Ibid.

## 10

In the case of hydrogen, the hydrogen economy is being forecast to create a global market with
revenues of US$2.5 trillion each year and provide 30 million jobs globally.10 As noted above Australia
is well positioned to develop a hydrogen export sector which could assist with the growth of the
domestic hydrogen economy.

## 10 Ibid.

## 11

### Measures to support the acceleration of electric vehicle
uptake

Supportive measures to encourage ZEV uptake have been adopted by governments around the
world in recognition of the benefits of integrating these vehicles into national fleets. It should be noted
that these measures generally apply a technology neutral approach in that they target all zero
emissions technologies in recognition that supporting a range of offerings is a more effective method
to achieve their objectives, be it environmental or economic. HMA therefore urges that governments
at all levels take a similar approach in designing ZEV support measures in Australia.

Australia is relatively unique in its application of supportive measures, in that meaningful support to
incentivise consumer purchase of ZEVs are inconsistent across states and territories, and at a
federal level, are limited to only one support measure - preferential luxury car tax (LCT) treatment.
Australia therefore has an exciting opportunity to develop a new holistic framework that not only
includes supportive measures for ZEVs but also their associated infrastructure across all levels of
government. Consideration must also be given however to the impact that the mass uptake of ZEVs
has on government revenues, so any assistance needs to take account for this or consider
complementary measures, such as road user charging, to minimise this impact.

HMA understands that a package of supporting measures is being considered as part of the
Australian Government’s Ministerial Forum into Vehicle Emissions in parallel with the introduction of
a light vehicle CO₂ emissions standard. We look forward to the outcomes of this work and urge the
Australian Government to take advantage of this opportunity to reshape transport policy in Australia
in a way that supports the country’s transition to a low carbon economy through accelerating the
introduction and adoption of clean transport technologies.

There are a range of policy options to increase availability and reduce upfront costs until ZEVs reach
purchase price parity. HMA therefore recommends that across all levels of government, a range of
financial and practical market incentives be introduced to encourage greater consumer, business and
government adoption of ZEVs and infrastructure. This holistic support package should cover five key
categories:

### • Vehicle incentive measures
• Private and public fleet procurement policies • • Consistent regulations, codes and standards
•

### Infrastructure support measures

### Information and education

### Vehicle incentive measures

Income tax credits introduced on ZEV purchase: To reduce the initial price differential between
standard ICE vehicles and ZEVs, income tax concessions may be a more palatable lever for
government to stimulate demand versus upfront purchase subsidies, and is a common approach
applied in other major markets, including the US and parts of the EU. These measures are typically
designed with limits on their application, such as in the US where phase outs are applied after a
company sells 200,000 electric vehicles.

Preferential LCT treatment applied to ZEVs: While the LCT threshold is higher for fuel efficient
vehicles, this tax will still be applied to vehicles valued over $75,526. Due to price premiums attached
to ZEVs (due to being a new technology with low production volumes), most models will incur LCT at
point of purchase therefore penalising this technology. HMA recommends, that at least until price
parity is reached, ZEVs be provided with an exclusion from the LCT. It is expected this would have
negligible impact on government revenues due to expected low vehicle volumes in the short term.

## 12

Alternatively, the LCT could be redesigned as a ‘high emission tax’ to encourage behavioural change
in purchasing decisions that preference ZEVs over petrol and diesel vehicles. This tax would levy a
charge on vehicles that are on the higher end of the CO₂ and noxious emissions spectrum. This
would send a strong signal that the government is committed to serious emissions reductions in the
Australian transport fleet.

Stamp duty exemptions applied to ZEVs: International experience demonstrates that upfront
exemptions are more effective at stimulating demand than annual or ongoing discounts, as
consumer’s factor upfront costs more into purchasing decisions than ongoing costs. Stamp duty
exemptions can therefore be a powerful signal to consumers. As an example, the ACT Government
applies nil stamp duty to vehicles with CO₂ emissions under 130g/km.

Registration discounts applied to ZEVs: Discounts for registration of environmentally friendly
vehicles are already available in some Australian states and territories, however national coverage is
important from a consistency perspective and to support country wide uptake of the technology.
International experience shows that implementing registration discounts, stamp duty exemptions and
tax offsets in unison can be more effective than any one of these policies in isolation.

Introduction of road-user charging: Alternatively, stamp duty and registration charges (as well as
fuel excise) could be replaced by a user pricing system whereby vehicle owners are charged based
on the distance they drive. This approach would not only manage road congestion, it could also be
designed in way to incentivise the use of ZEVs through a preferential charging structure. Further, it
represents a means to replace lost excise revenue that will occur through BEV growth. The
Australian Government flagged an inquiry into road user pricing in 2016 however next steps are
currently unclear. HMA looks forward to further details of this review.

Fuel excise: Further to the above, any taxation treatment to ZEV fuels i.e. hydrogen or electricity
must be equitable. That is, hydrogen should not be penalised as a zero-emission fuel over electricity
through the application of excise for example. To achieve deep decarbonisation of the Australian
transport fleet while encouraging new technologies to grow, any disincentive of one technology over
another should be avoided to ensure a technology agnostic approach.

Non-financial incentives offered for ZEVs: A range of non-financial measures in conjunction with
the initiatives outlined above can send a positive signal to the marketplace about governments
embracing ZEV technology. Offerings such as toll discounting, and preferential lane access and
parking have been adopted as a stimulative measure in countries such as South Korea, Germany,
Norway and the US.

Introduction of a light vehicle emission standard: One important measure that influences the
supply of new light vehicles to the market place based on environmental performance is a light
vehicle CO₂ standard. Despite discussions commencing in 2009, Australia has yet to introduce such
a standard. HMA urges the timely commencement of a national CO₂ target to provide certainty for
industry to invest in ZEV technology and to stimulate their supply to Australia which, under the
proposed scheme, can be utilised by manufacturers to offset emissions of higher emitting vehicles.

### Private and public fleet procurement policies

Introduction ZEV targets for government fleets: Governments can play a leading role in driving
acceptance and take up of ZEVs. Commitments such as the ACT Government’s announcement that
all their newly leased passenger vehicles will be ZEVs from 2020-21 (where fit for purpose)
demonstrates public sector leadership and sends a strong signal to the private sector that the
technology is tried, tested and suitable for wider fleet adoption. In addition, the Queensland
Government’s recent commitment to double ZEV numbers in their fleet each year to 2022 is also
another positive example.

## 13

The Australian Government fleet policy includes no specific requirements relating to the emissions of
fleet vehicles only that government entities ‘should prioritise vehicles with low CO₂ emissions’. As one
of the largest fleet operators in Australia, the Australian Government has an opportunity to
demonstrate leadership by redesigning its policy to improve the environmental sustainability of its
fleet by including ZEV targets.

HMA therefore recommends that ZEV targets be adopted by not only the Australian Government, but
also state, territory and local governments that have yet to make this commitment. This is important
to provide the initial customer base needed to stimulate wider adoption and support infrastructure
roll-out.

Government support for private fleets to integrate ZEVs including fringe benefits tax (FBT)
exemptions: Uptake of ZEVs in private fleets is similarly important for motivating large-scale
demand. To stimulate private fleet uptake, HMA recommends the removal of FBT on ZEVs to
mitigate the typically higher costs of these vehicles with a plan to remove at point of price parity with
ICE vehicles. Government can also play a role in influencing the composition of private fleets by
providing guidance and education on ZEV fleet adoption, which is further outlined below.

 policies that influence private and public fleet purchasing patterns can have a
substantial impact on the overall market. HMA therefore encourages the Committee to examine this
area closely. In the case of FCEVs, due to their infrastructure requirements, it is recognised that the
initial customer base will be fleets which will in turn drive demand from individual consumers. An
increased uptake in fleets will of course also increase the number of ZEVs available for purchase in
the second-hand market.

Development of ZEV infrastructure deployment strategies: Australian Government leadership
and support for the development of a national ZEV infrastructure roadmap, including establishing a
national electric vehicle uptake target (incorporating FCEVs), identifying priorities and actions
required to drive uptake and facilitate consultation, and engagement across industry is needed to
guide and drive growth in the sector.

Government to co-invest in ZEV infrastructure: Public-private partnerships can be important in
the initial stages of infrastructure deployment for new technologies. This will enable investment from
industry, investors and government to be leveraged providing a ‘jump start’ to the roll out of hydrogen
refuelling station infrastructure across a geographical area, noting this is a fundamental precondition
of the introduction of FCEVs. International examples of this in practice are outlined below.

### Consistent regulations, codes and standards

Adopt internationally harmonised and consistent regulations, codes and standards:
Consistency of regulations, codes of standards both internationally and between Australian
jurisdictions is highly important to ensure the successful proliferation of ZEVs and their infrastructure.
When identified, developed and adopted early, standards can enable the streamlined rollout of
technologies in the market and help to support innovation and change in the supply chain and
associated infrastructure.

Discussions regarding Australia’s approach to full volume importation of FCEVs have recently
commenced between manufacturers and the Department of Infrastructure and Regional
Development. Manufacturers seek an efficient pathway to FCEV import to Australia that achieves
minimal regulatory burden while ensuring safety concerns are adequately addressed. Due to the
wider community benefits of these vehicles and compliance in overseas markets, it is important that
their entry to Australia is not unnecessarily stifled.

## 14

From a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure perspective, specific standards have been developed
overseas, most notably ISO standards which provide guidance on safety and performance and cover
hydrogen production, delivery, compression, storage and fuelling. These ISO standards are yet to be
adopted in Australia which has led to some uncertainty for the design and implementation of
Australian projects. HMA is working with Standards Australia to rectify this situation.

Government delivery of targeted education campaigns in collaboration with industry: Targeted
education campaigns led by governments to inform the public of these technologies, including safety-
related aspects are essential for increasing consumer confidence. Promotion of supportive measures
in place to encourage vehicle purchase is also important to build public awareness.

Initial consumer concerns regarding ‘green technology’ may have been valid (range anxiety, premium
purchase price) however, consumer opinion has not moved in keeping with the significant
technological advances and resulting increased options available in the zero-emission vehicle space.
HMA will shortly launch a hydrogen educational website which will include a focus on raising
awareness of FCEVs. We would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with governments on this
initiative.

Government support for ZEV trials and demonstrations: When effectively conducted, trials and
demonstrations can be a powerful and often an essential marketing tool for new technologies. In
Australia, this is particularly important for governments to demonstrate the suitability, safety and
benefits of ZEVs for fleet use.

### Opportunities for and measures to attract electric vehicle
manufacturing, and supply and value chain services

With the closure of local vehicle manufacturing in 2016-17, Australia is no longer regarded as a
global automotive hub. However, as all three local manufacturers have retained an R&D presence in
the country, Australia may be positioned favourably for a re-emergence of automotive related activity.
This is likely to be in areas including component and equipment design and manufacture, and IT
development rather than vehicle manufacturing due to the challenges with re-establishing supply
chains. However, supportive measures must be in place to attract investment in these areas or risk
losing this activity to jurisdictions with more favourable government policy and operating
environments. Specific initiatives recommended for adoption by the Australian Government to deliver
both confidence and certainty to the marketplace that Australia is preparing for a ZEV future are
outlined below.

From a hydrogen refuelling perspective, most equipment is manufactured overseas and imported to
Australia as required. While demand is currently low and the business case not yet sufficiently strong
to justify the establishment of new manufacturing plants, some HMA members have expressed
interest in establishing a presence in Australia for hydrogen related equipment. An example of the
potential value of hydrogen connected manufacturing is being seen in the US, where the Federal
Government has estimated their fuel cell industry was worth $2 billion in 2017 with 70,000 fuel cell
units shipped worldwide and over 100MW of electrolysers sold domestically and overseas.17 The fuel
cell sector in particular is supported by investment tax credits and R&D assistance.

Development of a national ZEV strategy: Australia currently lacks an overarching strategy for its
transition towards a ZEV fleet, and the investment and employment opportunities that could be
created through R&D, manufacturing, and infrastructure deployment. A guiding document is needed
to determine Australia’s global comparative advantages and outline a pathway to optimise these
strengths. Such a strategy should be led by the Australian Government and could include initiatives
to foster growth across the ZEV supply chain and its associated skills development needs as well as
measures to increase vehicle uptake and be supported by public funding.

Review of the potential ongoing role of the Automotive Transformation Scheme: The Australian
Government’s Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) aims to encourage competitive investment,
innovation and economic sustainability in the Australian automotive industry through funding support
for vehicle and component manufacturing, and R&D activities. The program is currently legislated to
close in 2020 after which there will be no dedicated program for automotive support in Australia. If
the ZEV strategy recommended above indicates that economic benefits could be delivered from an
automotive industry in Australia focussed on new technologies, then there may be benefit in
reframing this program to accommodate this.

Establish a dedicated office for zero emission vehicles: Currently federal transport policy spans
three government departments: The Department of the Environment & Energy, the Department of
Industry, Innovation & Science; and the Department of Infrastructure & Regional Development. To
streamline and centralise transport policy decision making and program implementation, HMA
recommends the Australian Government establish a dedicated office for zero emission vehicles
comprised of representatives from the relevant federal government departments. This office could
also lead coordination between state, territory and local governments to optimise opportunities
associated with ZEV promotion, use and manufacture.

The UK Office for Low Emission Vehicles for example has been established as a cross government
initiative to support the early market for ultra-low emission vehicles. The Office comprises staff and
funding from the Department for Transport, Department for Business Innovation & Skills; and the
Department of Energy & Climate Change. With a total budget of over £900 million, their objective is
to position the UK at the global forefront of low emission vehicle development, manufacture and use
to contribute to economic growth, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

### Government collaboration initiatives to support electric
vehicle uptake and manufacturing, supply, and value chain activities

Coordination across all levels of government in conjunction with industry engagement is essential if
Australia is to optimise the benefits of any new clean technology sector. Forums such as COAG that
facilitate collaboration between governments are an important starting point for discussion, but the
sector is now at a stage where initiatives to harness interest across governments and translate this
into actionable plans is now required.

As noted above, a national framework is first required to highlight areas for prioritisation on the basis
that they generate a net economic and community benefit. However, specific areas where
government collaborative efforts should be prioritised are outlined below.

Develop a national infrastructure plan for hydrogen refuelling infrastructure: Coordination
across all levels of government is important for the planning associated with the deployment of
national refuelling station network. It could include federal government for national strategic direction
setting, transport policy and regulations and funding support; state and territory governments for
infrastructure codes and standards, land use planning and funding; and local governments for
planning approval and community engagement.

In collaboration with industry, the plan should map a potential network for hydrogen refuelling
infrastructure to achieve nation-wide coverage, set a target number of stations, identify approaches
for efficient infrastructure roll out, consider funding models and ascertain areas of regulatory reform
required at all levels of government and responses to address these.

From a hydrogen perspective, HMA is currently working with Standards Australia to review the
current status of hydrogen related standards in Australia and identify areas where Australia is yet to
adopt the relevant international standards. To formally commence this process, Standards Australia
will host a workshop session for industry consultation purposes where all levels of government with
interests in hydrogen will be invited to participate. Once delivered, this will be an important piece of
work that will provide industry and governments with the confidence and certainty to invest in this
new sector.

Establish public-private partnerships for infrastructure deployment: Partnerships between all
levels of government and industry will be important while the commercial aspects of refuelling
projects are not yet sufficiently robust until such a point that a customer base is developed, and
vehicle volumes reach critical mass. For this reason, public-private partnerships are essential in the
initial stages of infrastructure deployment. This will enable investment from industry, investors and
government to be leveraged providing a ‘jump start’ to the roll out of stations across prioritised
geographical areas that include the initial customer base i.e. private and commercial fleet or heavy
freight networks, noting this is a fundamental precondition of the introduction of FCEVs.

HMA is currently undertaking an analysis of best practice in global hydrogen refuelling infrastructure
deployment with a focus on two organisations: H2 Mobility Germany and Japan H2 Mobility, both of
which are dedicated to optimising infrastructure roll out through centralising government and industry
funds. Their activities reflect overarching government strategy towards encouraging the uptake of

hydrogen mobility through infrastructure deployment. HMA would welcome the opportunity to engage
with all levels of government as we investigate pathways for Australia’s refuelling station roll out and
our potential role in national infrastructure strategy and planning.
