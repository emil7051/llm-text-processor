### Hurdle - Description

Current heavy-vehicle mass limits prevent battery-electric and hydrogen
trucks from carrying equivalent payloads due to their heavier components,
### reducing economic viability.

Australia's unique truck design rules (limiting trailer width to ~2.5m) restrict
available zero-emission models, as trucks must be ~2% narrower than in
other markets. Rules on axle spacing and tyre configuration further limit
allowable loads, impeding importation of newer models and the use of
efficiency measures like wide single tyres. There are safety concerns about
## changes.

Regulations for mass, dimensions, and road access vary across states,
creating a complex patchwork of exemptions. Some states (like NSW) have
interim zero-emission vehicle mass exemptions, but these aren't uniform
### nationwide, adding compliance overhead and uncertainty.

Australia lacks binding greenhouse gas standards or zero-emission sales
targets for heavy vehicles, reducing manufacturer incentives to supply zero-
emission models to the Australian market. Grattan Institute recommends
introducing ZEV truck sales targets (starting at 2% in 2024, rising to ~100%
## by 2040).

The absence of a unified national roadmap with specific interim freight
decarbonisation targets creates policy uncertainty, causing industry to delay
action despite long investment lead times for trucks and infrastructure.

 Many depots and truck stops face delays and high costs to upgrade grid
connections for high-power charging. Local network capacity is often
insufficient for large charging loads, requiring substantial infrastructure
upgrades.
### Tech for smart charging

Demand-based electricity tariffs (peak demand charges) can make fast-
charging extremely costly, disincentivising installation of depot and en-route
chargers. While wholesale electricity costs can be managed (down to
~5c/kWh) with PPAs and hedging, network demand tariffs remain
problematic.
I need certainty on my elec price to run business or site well. Generally
achieved if scaled, but there is a shortfall in the early years due to
## utilisation.

Regulatory frameworks for heavy-duty battery and fuel cell recycling, reuse,
and disposal are underdeveloped. Extended producer responsibility
schemes, recycling standards, and end-of-life management pathways are
not yet established, creating uncertainty about lifecycle environmental
## impacts and costs.

Very few publicly-accessible charging stations suitable for heavy trucks
exist on freight corridors, limiting zero-emission vehicle use to shorter
routes or requiring impractical detours. This is especially problematic given
Australia's geography and trucking routes, as well as the hotter climates that
### can degrade battery efficiency.

Ultra-high-power charging standards (e.g., megawatt chargers) are not yet
deployed, raising interoperability concerns. Similarly, standards for
hydrogen refuelling pressure and nozzles need harmonisation, potentially
delaying infrastructure rollout.
Hydrogen refuelling stations are virtually non-existent in Australia beyond a
few pilot sites. Until a refuelling network is built out, fleet operators cannot
practically deploy hydrogen trucks for long-range routes.
Electrolysers and green hydrogen systems not at commercial viability
tipping point
### Need to think about MW / fast charging development

 Zero-emission heavy trucks cost significantly more than diesel equivalents
(up to AUD$200,000 more for articulated trucks). This price premium,
combined with uncertainty around battery life and resale value, makes fleet
### operators hesitant to invest.

Financiers are uncertain about zero-emission truck values over time due to
questions about battery longevity, future technology changes, and second-
hand demand. This leads to higher financing costs and concerns about
### resale value that discourage uptake.

Australia lacks targeted incentives to offset the higher capital cost of zero-
emission trucks, with no federal purchase subsidy or nationwide tax credit
for heavy EVs. Climateworks recommends measures like tax breaks, grants,
### or credits to make zero-emission trucks competitive.

The Australian market has very limited selection and supply of zero-
emission truck models, with few right-hand-drive options. Manufacturers
prioritise other markets (EU, US, China) due to Australia's small market size
### and lack of strong emission standards.

Australia's freight industry is highly fragmented with many small businesses
and owner-drivers who lack capital for zero-emission trucks and may
struggle with operational uncertainties like charging downtime. Without
targeted support, the transition may be limited to large fleets.

The current road-funding system doesn't fully accommodate zero-emission
vehicles. While electric trucks currently don't pay equivalent road taxes,
uncertainty exists about the possibility that future governments may impose
distance-based charges, making long-term cost planning difficult.

There's a shortage of technicians trained to service high-voltage truck
drivetrains or hydrogen systems. Towing and repair services for heavy EVs
or FCEVs are not widely established, potentially causing longer downtime
for early adopters. Mechanics, spare parts, and emergency repair services
for electric or hydrogen trucks are not widely available, especially in remote
### areas, raising concerns about potential downtime.

Australia lacks clear policy on biofuels for heavy transport with no national
renewable diesel mandate or strong incentives. Administrative barriers exist
for using higher biodiesel blends (>5%), and limited domestic production
means renewable fuels remain a minor part of zero-emission strategy.
Government and large corporate procurement doesn't prioritise zero-
emission logistics. Without green procurement requirements, demand
### signals for zero-emission trucks remain weak.

Lack of viable rail or intermodal options means road freight carries a larger
decarbonisation burden, which is especially challenging for long-haul
routes.
It remains unclear whether batteries, hydrogen, or other technologies will
dominate long-haul trucking, making investment risky for operators.

 Battery trucks have shorter range and require charging breaks, impacting
logistics. Schedules and routes must be adjusted for charging or refuelling,
requiring more planning and potentially additional vehicles.

Effective policy implementation requires coordination across transport,
energy, environment, industry, skills and regional development agencies
that is currently lacking. Without formal coordination mechanisms spanning
federal and state governments, policy efforts remain fragmented and may
### work at cross-purposes.

Current approaches lack clear responsibility assignment, monitoring
systems, and adjustment mechanisms. Without dedicated implementation
bodies, progress tracking, and regular policy review processes, well-
intentioned policies risk failing to deliver practical outcomes.

Fleet operators and infrastructure planners lack practical information and
decision tools to guide transition planning. The absence of credible,
accessible guidance on technology selection, infrastructure requirements,
operational adjustments, and business case development creates planning
### paralysis and reinforces status quo operations.

Australia has limited domestic manufacturing and assembly capability for
zero-emission heavy vehicles or components. Without strategic industry
development policy, Australia risks missing economic opportunities in the
transition while remaining dependent on imported vehicles and
technologies that may not be optimized for local conditions.
Limited Australian battery manufacturing capacity and reliance on imported
components create supply risks. Without supply chain policy, zero-emission
### truck availability may be constrained.

When vehicle owners differ from operators, or when contracts don't reward
emissions reductions, zero-emission vehicle adoption is disincentivised.
Contract structures often don't account for different operational profiles of
### zero-emission vehicles.

## Solutions?

Grattan Institute / ClimateWorks recommend updating the Heavy Vehicle
National Law to allow trucks to carry up to 7 tonnes on their steer axle from
2023, as long as the truck is fitted with tyres that are at least 375mm wide.

The recently announced Safer Freight Vehicles package increases the overall
width for Prime Movers from 2.5 to 2.55 metres, enhancing the safety and freight
productivity of new trucks. Trailers are stuck at 2.5m - should move to 2.6m.

Needs a coordinated national approach through the Heavy Vehicle National
Law - with all signatory states adopting changes.
### I think safety and driver breaks would also fit in here.

Grattan recommends: Introduce binding zero-emissions sales targets for new
trucks (starting at 2% in 2024, rising to 100% by 2040 for rigid trucks and 70%
for articulated trucks); introduce a fuel efficiency standard. Note Euro VI.

BZE recommends that by 2030 all new commercial vehicle sales are zero
emissions and we have retrofit 20,000 ICE trucks to electric. By 2040, all buses
### and trucks on Australian roads are zero-emission models

 Visibility of capacity data and coordinated planning on this is key. Logic
check -
are the grid capacity investments and local subsidies the same issue or
## separate?

Targeted investment in charging infrastructure. BZE mentions Janus Electric's
battery swap-out stations. Collaborate with industry through the Driving the
## Nation Fund.

[BH: this was a problem in consumer early days, but there's been great progress
on plug harmonisation and OCCP adoption for chargers. Not sure where we are
### up to with this in HV specific chargers]

 Upfront purchase rebates, stamp duty exemptions, or accelerated depreciation

Targeted support (such as tailored financing, aggregated purchasing or rental
### models) to achieve a just and equitable transition

Climateworks highlights the need for training and skills programs to grow
ancillary industries around zero-emission trucks – a gap that represents a
softer
## barrier to uptake.

Without government direction (such as a blending standard or sustainability
framework), renewable fuels remain a minor part of the zero-emission heavy
## fleet strategy.
