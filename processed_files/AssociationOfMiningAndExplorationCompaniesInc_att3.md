## Executive Summary

An exponential growth is forecast in the global battery market.

Australia has a remarkable opportunity to benefit from local advantages as it is:

• now responsible for mining the majority of the world’s lithium; and • mining all of the minerals necessary to domestically manufacture batteries.

Now is the time for Government and industry to act as other supplier countries are
already acting to value-add downstream.

Governments, industry, and the research sector, must capitalise on this unique, once-in-a-generation confluence of local advantages to value-add. For the
foreseeable future, Australia can continue to dominate lithium spodumene mining.
Government has frequently referred to downstream processing, and the possibility
of adding further value to resources rather than mining and direct shipping out.

This Report details the lithium value chain, and how Australia can ensure future
generations with massive economic and social benefit from our current substantial
comparative advantage.

Report recommendations open the conversation of how Government and industry can collaboratively work to ensure the greatest possible return in a fiercely
competitive global market.

It is crucial that action is taken quickly so Australia takes a share of the thousands
of new jobs (skilled and semi-skilled) in this two trillion-dollar value chain.

If the Government wants Australia’s future generations to benefit from this opportunity it must:

### 1. Build awareness of Australia’s lithium opportunity;
2. Get the policy setting right to support industry development in Australia;

## and
3. Act now.

urgency to make the most of the opportunity.

## but must act with

Today, it is widely understood that storing energy in batteries is a rapidly growing
disruptor for the entire energy sector. Annual compound growth estimates baseline above 10%, with some estimates indicating periods of year on year
growth of 50% peaking during the mid 2020’s. These rates will be impacted by multiple factors including consumer technology adoption rates, cost reduction,
impact of environmental policies, functional convenience and driven by competitive tension between new and existing manufacturers.

It is also accepted that Lithium, due to its availability and chemical ability to
efficiently mobilise electrical charge, will remain as the key material component of
these batteries well beyond 2030. Lithium is the third lightest element and is the
metal with the highest energy density by weight. Exploiting lithium as an energy
store has allowed EV’s and other weight-sensitive electronic applications, such as
mobile electronics, power tools and, most recently, robots and drones, to become
ubiquitous.

The diverse commercial interest in energy storage has driven further research and
development in battery technology. The sales demand growth is also delivering economies of scale in the production of ever-improving batteries. The result of
both of these factors have combined to extend the advantage that lithium based storage currently holds over any competing technology.

Despite the extraordinarily high level of interest, in 2017 lithium is a small global
market.

Nevertheless, the rising trend in demand for lithium chemicals over the next few
years is inarguable. Indeed, growing demand has led Signum Box to note that the industry needs “a new project entering the market every year to satisfy growing
demand1”. Further, significant growth into the next decade is also assured; the question remains the rate and scale of growth. As the lithium industry moves
forward, it must rapidly reposition itself from a second- or third-tier ore and metal
processor, to a first-tier, strategically important industry central to the world’s
economy and energy security for at least the next two decades.

Australia is in the enviable position of having large reserves of Lithium in the form
of hard rock. This resource is very accessible by established mining technology and already deployed in other mining applications by a substantive, skilled, and
efficient mining industry in Australia. By comparison, most other major global reserves are held in salt lakes and are extracted by natural evaporation. Whilst
this allows producers in, for example, South America to enjoy low operational costs, their pathway to expand production is both environmentally and technically
challenging, more costly, time-consuming and to a large extent, weather dependant. In comparison, the advantage for Australia’s producers is that they can
rapidly, cost-effectively and predictably expand production to meet demand using
established technology. This is demonstrated by Australia’s likely capture of as
much as 60% (2017 estimate based on shipments to date) of the global market based upon the contracted supply from Australia for this year of some 24,300
contained tonnes of lithium (LME) compared to the global consumption forecast of
most forecasters (incl. Signum Box) of 40,000 tonnes of LME.

There are substantial value-add opportunities along the value chain transforming
lithium from mineral to end-product lithium for the massively growing driver of lithium as an energy storage enabler (Fig. 1):

### Figure 1 – Lithium Transformation Chain

Along with the increase in demand for lithium, prices for the refined product have
risen and logistics efficiencies have been sought. Australian producers have traditionally “concentrated” their ore close to the mine-site to reduce the physical
volume of ore moved, although such concentrating still results in shipments of product of only 6% lithium content. Higher value lithium refining and further
processing has typically taken place offshore driven by the historical position China established from its own relatively small lithium extraction (Fig. 2)

## 3

Figure 2 Lithium value chain 2017 – In country baselines (green USD for Australia, white for global)

As a result of the chemistry of lithium in concentrate, the act of processing concentrate further into battery grade product delivers a more than six-fold
efficiency in transport and logistics. Accordingly, by building this processing closer
to the mine, value is also created by significant cost savings. The industry comment frequently made around local refining is “why do we export a product
that is 94% waste?”

The value chain snapshot of major product suppliers for 2017 can also be examined through revenue share by country or region (Fig. 3). A highlight is the
dichotomy between the major lithium producers (Australia, Chile, Argentine) and the major downstream industrial manufacturers (Korea, Japan). China is a smaller
producer, but has a major presence in downstream processing. Europe and the USA are rapidly emerging system manufacturers, largely based upon Korean and
Japanese technology. They are also expanding into battery manufacture, but output to date has been modest in the global context. Their growth motivation is
the demand being forecast by auto makers to rapidly transition to electric drive-
trains for manufacturing cost reductions (thousands of fewer components per vehicle), combined with emerging regulatory imposts as more nations seek to end
sales of combustion engine vehicles in the coming decades to combat both air pollution and to meet international emission commitments.

Among global lithium producers, the trend is to further refine the product to a high
degree of purity closer to the mine-site. This increasingly reduces logistics costs
while also capturing high returns. Unfortunately appraising the mid-stream (electro-chemical component) flows is challenging because of the lack of available
transactional data.

Using our lithium transformation chain approach (Fig. 4), the actual gaps limiting
Australia’s capability to deliver across the entire value chain are relatively small.

In Australia, we are currently transitioning into this second stage of processing
through Tianqi’s investment in Kwinana, due before 20202. The world’s other large Lithium producers, SQM, FMC and Albemarle and Ganfeng, are similarly
expanding investment in refining, driven by the value-add opportunity. The 2020 forecast value chain (Fig. 5) reveals other producing countries are ahead of
Australia in this transition. While this is a disadvantage to our export value potential, it has allowed the development of significant innovation towards new,
efficient methods for refining (i.e. electrolysis extraction).

In considering further creation of downstream processing in Australia towards production of battery grade lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate, a review of
nine development projects - in Finland, Australia, Chile; Bolivia, Argentina - has
established a relative benchmark of USD13.6M per kiloton of annual production.
This target applies provided the targeted facility production is at least 20 ktpa of
battery grade product. At smaller plant sizes (below 10 ktpa) construction costs
exceed USD 20M per ktpa.

The review also indicates that these production costs appear to be lowest in Australia (Tianqi) and Chile. Production cost information has not been sourced for
China, but it is understood that logistics, tailored subsidies, the relatively segmented nature of component manufacture, and the relative age (and
technology) of Chinese facilities indicates that production costs are unlikely to be
significantly lower that these baselines.

While a current hub location is effectively emerging in Kwinana, it is interesting to
imagine other possible locations. As an example for regional Australia, an estimate
of the cost of construction of a production facility in the Pilbara would be in the
order of 1.3 times that of an existing industrial hub (extrapolating from Regional
Development Australia report on the cost of doing business in the Pilbara).
Accordingly, a target construction cost of a 20,000 ktpa facility would be in the
order of USD350M. This cost per ktpa would be on a par with large plants in Argentina and Bolivia, and well below smaller scale plants in Argentina and
Finland.

Another factor supporting further local value add is that the largest cost component (approximately 40%) of plant operating cost is apportioned to the
chemical reagents used in processing. Of some 14 typical reagents and consumables (including lithium and gas), 13 are already produced in Australia.
Only one reagent (Soda Ash) is now imported, since the 2013 closure of a plant in
South Australia.

The evidence indicates that, pending detailed cost and risk analysis, any sufficiently large battery chemical plant in Australia will be globally cost effective,
and would likely have more predictable per tonne operating costs (compared to Brine-based lithium) due to the dependability of hard-rock supply.

In this value stage, Australia also has very significant opportunities due to our
existing resources of other electro-chemical inputs including copper, nickel, cobalt and aluminium. Arguably, Australia could become a dominant global
producer of these direct battery inputs with the additional benefits of directly
supporting energy storage innovation in industry and academia. While there are various MOUs and early stage proposals to develop such manufacturing plants in
namely Townsville3 and Darwin4 - but nothing is yet certain.

Recent demonstrations from Queensland’s University of Technology show the prototype for relatively low-cost Australian manufacture of battery cells5. Other
lithium based technology developments (such as 24-M) are showing very significant cost/performance improvements with significantly lower capital cost of
entry. It appears probable that the cost of building battery manufacturing could
reduce by an order of magnitude.

In a “Business as Usual” scenario, based upon expected developments and global demand estimates the lithium value chain for 2025 would look like:

### Figure 6 Lithium value chain 2025 - forecast

## Value Capture

The Value Chain estimates have been based upon commercial demand forecasts for (lithium battery based) products, EV sales forecasts and stationary energy
storage for domestic and utility use. These forecasts diverge significantly over
time from that of extreme conservatism to that closer to the growth rate seen in
comparable disruptive technologies. It is also noted that some forecasters have not consistently considered resource constraints beyond known reserves. We
recognise that some of these resource constraints have yet to be tested, that exploration continuously identifies new sources, that research and development
constantly seeks low-cost solutions through substitute material (such as replacements for cobalt, synthetic graphite, etc.), that improved processing

efficiencies drive more yield at every stage and that battery recycling will become
increasingly relevant as end-of-life volumes increase.

However, as stated earlier, there is huge amount of opacity in trade and finance
data, so transactional data generally must be estimated.

Forecasters estimates (Table 1) have been reviewed upwards, and very often more than double year on year. For example, Signum Box advised of a 72% forecast
increase for 2017 from 2016. These growth rate differences become most prominent when looking at 2025 to 2030.

Australia, under a “business as usual” scenario, will continue to gain significantly
from lithium mining, but it is in danger of:

• Seeing a decline in its share of the total market value (downstream);
• Experiencing a negative balance of trade impact due to its need to reimport

demand for storage in Australia20;

### as highlighted in a recent report on potential

• Missing industry opportunities for innovation and commercialisation

through R&D; high-tech manufacturing and cross-sector synergies (such as energy trading; high-tech recycling; grid stabilisation).

## By way of comparison:

• Chile has begun to support downstream processing opportunities through

the issuing of concessions to 12 international concerns which will be able to access lithium resources (a state controlled commodity) at beneficial
pricing.21

• Argentina currently has an MOU with battery and automotive manufacturer

### BYD for the building of EVs in the country.22

• China has a range of government policy settings and industry support

programs to drive growth of the lithium value chain from production to final consumption. This includes both the adoption of electric vehicles and
stationary storage23, including the most recent announcement to phase out petrol- and diesel-fueled vehicles.24
Japan through METI has a range of programs that support the demand-pull for energy storage systems broadly across domestic and commercial
stationary storage. Japan also has a program in place to support consumer demand for electric vehicles through tax breaks.2526

• USA support programs include a range of incentives and tax exemptions for

hybrid and plug in electric vehicles.27 Furthermore, state and federal governments are supporting the development of value adding for energy
storage though the development battery factories such as the Tesla

Non-lithium producing countries in the EU are also adopting policies and incentives to the manufacture and adoption of energy storage, including specific
incentives from the EU to support EV battery production. Korean and Japanese companies (Panasonic, LG Chem and Samsung) are being encouraged to supply
technology and processes to build batteries and systems in the EU to support the
growing EV sector.

The key support theme is to create value added processing where it does not exist,
or where it does exist, to drive consumer demand and affordability for stationary
and mobile energy storage at the end of the Lithium Value Chain.

As Australia debates energy policy for the nation for the next decades, few Federal
regulatory measures or other incentives support the value adding or consumer demand aspects of the Lithium Value chain. The polarised political argument may
result in further state level interventions, as seen in South Australia with the
promised and delivered 100MW/129Mwh Tesla battery system32. There is some limited support in the ACT and Victoria for EV purchase, however in most cases,
the policy settings do not directly support driving consumer demand for either transport nor stationary energy storage.

Nevertheless, across Australia the Hansard record of debates in the Federal and State Parliaments reveals a ramping recognition of the importance and potential
value of lithium to Australia.

All jurisdictions in Australian all have plans for integrated microgrid solutions for
regional and remote communities that include battery storage. Further,

announcements around Australia in August have highlighted state governments’ willingness to support innovation and deliver outcomes in the energy storage
market. Australian governments have previously played a substantial role in developing energy infrastructure from the early days of infrastructure
development from the poles and wires to the Snowy Hydro scheme, building a gas pipelines.

### Recommendations to harvest Australia’s opportunity

The countries that have been the best to date to position themselves to exploit the
revolution driving the Lithium Value Chain have created policy settings, regulations, industry support and consumer demand drivers and are typified by
China, Korea and Japan. Except for China, these countries are not Lithium producers but have leveraged processing advantages and policy levers to position
themselves to value-add to Lithium within the global Value Chain.

These policy settings can serve multiple purposes: for example in Japan, a changing
energy paradigm post-Fukushima is driving the creation of economic opportunity as well as creating the environment for a change of paradigm and stabilisation
within the energy market.

Doing “business as usual” will certainly support economic benefit, but an aspirational while still realistic roadmap is required (Fig. 10).

### Figure 9 Lithium value-harvest roadmap

## 13

A lithium industry in Australia13Electric VehiclesSubmission 20 - Attachment 2

## Recommendations

### 1. Build awareness of Australia’s lithium opportunities.

1.1 Ensure lithium is a priority for all tiers of Australian government.

1.2 Noting that there is limited information, gather statistics exploration, mining, processing and trading volumes on lithium and other battery
minerals, such as nickel, cobalt and copper so that there is a firm statistical understanding of the market and of Australia’s opportunity.

1.3 Conduct a short-form national economic impact study on the potential of

### exporting lithium and lithium-based products.

### 2. Get the policy settings right

2.1 Explore the potential for State Agreements with industry to attract further

significant investment in lithium processing and value adding.

2.2 Prioritise all lithium related projects for lead agency (major/significant project) status to fast track approvals and the rapid development of the
industry.
