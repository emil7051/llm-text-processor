## Understanding the Science

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our planet today.
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities are
causing the Earth's temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes hundreds of
scientists from around the world, has concluded that human influence on the
climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases
are the highest in history.

### Key Evidence

* Global temperature has increased by about 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era
* Atmospheric CO2 levels have reached their highest point in 800,000 years
* Arctic sea ice and glaciers are rapidly diminishing
* Sea levels have risen by about 20cm over the past century

### Impact on Ecosystems

Climate change is already affecting many ecosystems around the world. Rising
temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering habitats, forcing
species to migrate or adapt.

| Ecosystem | Primary Impacts | Vulnerability Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coral Reefs | Bleaching, acidification | Very High |
| Arctic Tundra | Permafrost melt, habitat loss | High |
| Rainforests | Drought, fire susceptibility | Medium-High |

## Mitigation Strategies

Addressing climate change requires a multi-faceted approach that includes
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable energy sources, and
implementing policies to promote sustainability.

### Key Actions

1. Transition to renewable energy sources
2. Improve energy efficiency in buildings and transportation
3. Protect and restore forests and other carbon sinks
4. Develop climate-resilient agriculture

"The challenge of climate change calls for a comprehensive and immediate
response from all sectors of society."
