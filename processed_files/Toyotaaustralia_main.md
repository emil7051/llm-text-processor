## 2. Introduction

Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited (Toyota Australia) operated as a fully integrated
manufacturing, sales and distribution company for 54 years until the cessation of local manufacturing
operations on 3 October 2017.

Toyota Australia has retained a significant local presence in Australia beyond the closure of local
vehicle manufacturing, including import and distribution functions and a significant research and
development division. Planning is also underway for the establishment of a Centre of Excellence at the
former manufacturing site in Altona.

For the 15th consecutive year, Toyota Australia finished 2017 as the top selling automotive company
in Australia, with Toyota HiLux taking the number one sales position for the second year in a row.
Toyota Australia continues to contribute to the development of vehicles that meet the needs of local
and international markets, including a focus on vehicles powered by a range of alternative fuels and
those with the potential for automated driving.

Meanwhile, we continue to work towards vehicles that are safe for everyone, and that maintain the
standards of durability and reliability that people expect from the Toyota brand.

Globally, Toyota is actively engaged in creating environmentally friendly, safe and intelligent vehicles
that will enable mobility into the future. Toyota Australia specifically will continue to play a key role in
achieving this vision through our new R&D entity.

As society moves away from fossil fuels, there are many alternative vehicle fuels, each of which
has strengths and weaknesses. Toyota is responding to this by investing in innovation across a range
of vehicles including low emission vehicles such as hybrids, and the advanced powertrains of battery
electric and fuel cell electric vehicles.

Toyota has long been at the forefront of advanced technology dating back to 1999 when it became
the first brand to introduce hybrid technology to the global market and later to the Australian market
in 2001.

Toyota Australia is committed to ensuring the latest trends and innovative technologies within the
automotive industry are adopted in the Australian marketplace. The investment in acquiring and
sharing three Mirai fuel cell electric vehicles from Japan as well as procuring a mobile hydrogen
refueller is a demonstration of this commitment to innovative vehicle technology.

On that note, Toyota Australia strongly urges the consideration of fuel cell electric vehicles as part of
the scope of the Senate Committee. Fuel cell electric vehicles use electric motors as their sole means
of propulsion, however do not store electricity in the form of a battery and therefore are not
recharged using an ‘external electricity source’. These vehicles create electricity as required using
hydrogen gas stored on board and are recharged (refuelled) using equipment at service stations.

It is the position of Toyota Australia that fuel cell electric and battery electric vehicles are
complementary technologies and will play an equally important role in transitioning Australia to a low
emissions transport fleet.

### 3. Toyota Australia product

The first guiding principle of Toyota’s global operations includes the directive to ‘undertake open and
fair business activities to be a good corporate citizen of the world’. It is evident that there are many
challenges involved in tackling climate change and its potential effects on the world, and Toyota
Australia recognises that all industries and participants within those industries have a significant role
to play in mitigating this impact.

The automotive sector must be part of the solution in reducing CO₂ emissions and other pollutants
from vehicles that can have a harmful effect on the environment. In relation to specific initiatives
within the Australian economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Toyota Australia recognises the
important role of the automotive sector in contributing to the Australian Government’s commitment
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 – 28 per cent by 2030 [from 2005].

To highlight the priority that strong environmental performance plays in the global mindset of the
Toyota brand, Toyota Motor Corporation released the ‘Toyota 2050 Environmental Challenge’ in 2015
(refer Attachment 1). This sets out six challenges to achieve a sustainable society. As part of
Challenge 1 “New Vehicle Zero CO₂ Emissions”, Toyota has challenged itself to reduce global Toyota
vehicle CO₂ emissions by 90 per cent in comparison with 2010 levels, by 2050.

To realise this, in addition to mileage improvement of engine-driven vehicles, Toyota will promote the
development of next-generation vehicles with low, ultra-low or zero CO₂ emissions such as hybrid,
plug-in hybrid, battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and further accelerate the
dissemination of these vehicles. The achievement of all six challenges outlined in the 2050 vision are
contingent upon partnerships with government to deliver the necessary support and regulatory
environment to enact such change.

### 3.1 Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles

Toyota Australia’s commitment to the introduction of alternative vehicle technology is evidenced by
the importation of three units of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle in 2016. These leading technology vehicles
are used to showcase the technology and raise awareness of the potential of hydrogen as a practical
and sustainable alternative to fossil fuel based technologies with government, industry and the
general public. To build upon this awareness, Toyota Australia will import additional Mirai fuel cell
vehicles in late 2018 to conduct numerous real-world trials with both public and private stakeholders.

Due to a lack of permanent refuelling infrastructure in Australia, Toyota Australia self-invested in the
procurement of a mobile refueller which is currently housed at our Altona site. The goal of showcasing
the Mirai is to promote discussions surrounding the required infrastructure to introduce this
technology to the Australian market, as well as to stimulate the transition towards zero emission
vehicles.

Fuel cell vehicles are fuelled by hydrogen, an energy source that can be produced from both
renewable and non-renewable sources. This leading technology motor is powered by electricity
generated from a chemical reaction within a fuel cell between hydrogen and oxygen from the air,
which leaves only water as a by-product. The vehicles offer comparable performance to fossil fuel-
powered vehicles, but are quiet and produce no greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants (refer
Attachment 2).

The advantages of fuel cell electric vehicles over battery electric include refuelling time, whereby fuel
cells can be refuelled in just a few minutes, as well as extended range provided through additional
energy density. These advantages are particularly evident in commercial transport, including heavy
trucks, buses and trains. For the majority of consumers, one of the greatest advantageous of a fuel cell
vehicle is that it does not require a change in the user experience paradigm. The only difference

## 5

between refuelling a fuel cell and a current internal combustion vehicle is the fuel itself, unlike a
battery electric vehicle that requires charging instead of refuelling.

Toyota Australia’s position is that both fuel cell electric and battery electric vehicles are
complementary and that both products are required for meaningful transport sector emission
reductions (refer Attachment 3). We therefore urge that the fuel cell electric vehicles are not
overlooked by the Committee.

## 3.2 Hybrid vehicles

As at July 2018, Toyota has a range of five hybrid vehicles with the launch of the Corolla hybrid in mid-
2016, and another nine hybrids under the Lexus badge. The Camry Hybrid model is Australia’s best-
selling hybrid car and until October 2017 was built locally in Melbourne.

Simply put, a ‘hybrid’ is a vehicle with two or more power sources. Most hybrid cars use a normal
internal combustion engine paired with an electric motor. Beginning with the original Prius, Toyota
pioneered the ‘full’ hybrid system that uses two separate powerplants – a battery-powered electric
motor and petrol-driven combustion engine – which can work together to drive the vehicle or can
each be used in isolation.

One of the main benefits of a hybrid vehicle is that it requires no infrastructure development as a
hybrid self-charges the battery as it runs. This makes hybrid the perfect technology for the Australian
market as zero emission infrastructure development is in its infancy.

Proliferation of hybrid vehicles represents an attractive pathway for immediate CO₂ emission
reductions within the Australian fleet. However, despite launching in 2001, hybrids only represented
one per cent of new vehicles sold in 2017. Recent market research conducted in June 2018 suggests
there are two main barriers to hybrid uptake in the market:

1. Significant lack of understanding around hybrid technology as many consumers

### believe a hybrid needs to be ‘plugged-in’ to charge.

2. Hybrid vehicles are more expensive than your conventional petrol vehicle as they

consist of advanced technology components (two power sources).

Toyota Australia has embarked on an intensive marketing campaign to educate consumers on hybrid
technology, including sponsoring the 2017/2018 summer of cricket and the 2018 AFL Premiership
series. Toyota Australia continues to work towards closing the price differential between petrol and
hybrid vehicles, however due to manufacturing costs, price parity remains a challenge.

To accelerate the uptake of low emission vehicles government support will be necessary as
demonstrated in overseas markets. In the United States (US) there was an increase from under one
per cent market share in 2005 to four per cent market share in the space of five years with the
introduction of government incentives. Further in this submission there are a range of incentive
measures that can be implemented to accelerate the uptake of all low and zero emission vehicles.

4. The potential economic, environmental and social benefits of

### widespread electric vehicle uptake in Australia

The environmental benefits of widespread electric vehicle uptake include reduced CO2 emissions
from the Australian transport sector, not only due to tailpipe emissions but also the reduced reliance
on finite fossil fuel exploration and mining.

## 6

In 2017, Toyota sold its ten millionth hybrid car globally with the vehicles having saved each of their
owners an average of 2,770 litres of petrol, and together have averted approximately 77 million
tonnes of CO₂ emissions compared with similar petrol-powered vehicles. Low and zero emission
vehicles not only offer CO2 reduction but reduced emissions of harmful particles such as NOx,
therefore improving air quality which has long term environmental, health and economic benefits.

5. Measures to support the acceleration of electric vehicle uptake

To improve the supply of low emissions vehicles, there are many government led initiatives that
can be undertaken, including:

(cid:1) Support for Low, ultra-low and zero emission vehicle infrastructure: The facilitation of
investment for the required infrastructure for low emission vehicles will hasten their
introduction into the Australian marketplace as manufacturers will only commit to the large-
scale supply of these vehicles once infrastructure is in place.

## (cid:1)

Introduction of supportive regulations and infrastructure to facilitate the introduction of
co-operative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) technology: The proliferation of C-ITS
technology will have numerous benefits to the Australian light vehicle consumer, one of which
being improved driver behaviour. One of the benefits of introducing C-ITS equipped vehicles
will be smoother braking, lane changing and freeway entering / exiting, which will result in a
more consistent traffic flow and consequently fuel efficiency savings for Australian drivers.

On the demand side, there are many initiatives that can be undertaken by industry and government
alike that will support the purchase of low emissions vehicles. These initiatives include:

• Consumer incentives: Monetary and non-monetary mechanisms to promote the sale of low
and zero emission vehicles can be introduced by federal, state and local governments.
Suggested incentives include:
- Purchase rebates for low emission vehicles. These reduce the price gap between standard
internal combustion engines and more technologically advanced low emissions vehicles
(e.g. hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles)

- Amended stamp duty/vehicle registration calculation
- Preferential traffic/parking conditions for low emission vehicles (e.g. access to transit lanes,

### preferential parking access in CBD’s etc.)

- Rebates for trading in older higher polluting vehicles for newer low emission vehicles

(cid:1) Low, ultra-low and zero emission vehicle infrastructure: The benefit of significantly
increasing the infrastructure required for low emissions vehicles (e.g. plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) is three-fold; it promotes the sale of these vehicles by
manufacturers, increases vehicle appeal to consumers as there will be sufficient infrastructure
in place to support the ongoing use of these vehicles and improves Australia’s energy security
through the supply of alternative fuels.

(cid:1) Consumer education: One of the biggest impediments to introducing new or emerging
technology is scepticism and information gaps held by consumers. While manufacturers play a
key role in advertising and promoting new low emission technology, governments also play a
significant role in assisting in the spread of information on these technologies. This can be done
via coordinated and active promotion of low emission vehicles included in government fleets,
as well as public awareness campaigns designed to increase the knowledge of low emission
vehicle technology to Australian consumers.

## 7

(cid:1) Government fleet purchasing policies: While fleet policies play a role in directly creating
demand for low emissions vehicles, it is also an important signal to the wider community as to
the benefits of these vehicle types as well as a promotion of the models on offer within the
Australian market. By incorporating low emissions vehicle conditions in fleet policies, it also
ensures government takes a leadership position in stimulating this market which will have a
direct positive impact on the overall emissions of the Australian economy. A specific policy
change, such as mandating that all non-Euro 6 government fleet vehicles be changed over
within two years would send a strong signal to private fleets on the importance of this initiative.

(cid:1) Amended tax measures: There are many taxes and charges involved in the purchase and
ongoing use of light vehicles. While initiatives such as changes to stamp duty and registration
costs have been referenced above (‘consumer incentives’), there are additional changes to the
tax system that could also be considered to stimulate demand for low emission vehicles. This
includes tax write-offs for small businesses for purchase of low emission vehicles.

## (cid:1)

In-service emissions testing: Similar to the Japanese Government’s Shaken program and the
United Kingdom’s MOT initiative which require regular emission testing of on-road vehicles at
the owner’s expense. These measures not only contribute to limiting emissions over the life of
the vehicle but also work towards reducing the age of the country’s vehicle fleet through
increased vehicle turnover.

(cid:1) Eco-drive education programs: The introduction of eco-drive programs for vehicle owners at
touch points with state road authorities i.e. licence testing or renewal, vehicle registration etc.
or through law enforcement agencies i.e. for recipients of speeding fines and so forth. Toyota
Australia’s own internal eco-drive program saw participants demonstrate a 10 per cent
improvement in fuel efficiency when applying their learnings relative to their usual driving
behaviour.

(cid:1) Mirai trial programs: Toyota Australia is currently engaging with local, state and federal
government regarding real-world Mirai trials expected to begin in late 2018. The purpose of
these trials is to normalise fuel cell technology and to demonstrate the benefits of this advanced
technology. Toyota Australia would welcome the opportunity to discuss this pilot program
further with government stakeholders.

## 5.1 Consumer awareness

As demonstrated by the volume of new vehicle sales of both hybrid and electric derivatives (1.0% of
new vehicle sales in 2017), consumer appetite for alternative fuelled vehicles in Australia is low
relative to other OECD markets (3.5% in the US and 2.1% in the EU in 2014).

Given the reduced resonance of fuel savings as a motivator to purchase a hybrid vehicle for instance,
demand side incentives play an important role in promoting the uptake of these vehicles. This is
evidenced in overseas markets, such as the US Government’s tax credit of up to $7,500 USD to lower
the upfront cost of plug-in electric vehicles.

It is clear from Australian and overseas evidence that in the absence of strong monetary and/or non-
monetary incentives, the substitution from petrol/diesel vehicles to alternatives such as hybrids, fuel
cell and battery electrics will be gradual. We therefore again encourage the Federal Government to
consider measures to stimulate the purchase of these vehicles.

As raised above, government fleet policies also raise awareness of the benefits of alternative fuelled
vehicles and provide an important signal to consumers of the importance and advantages of these

## 8

technologies. Governments should demonstrate leadership in this space, both at the bureaucratic and
political level as a means to set the direction for broader Australian fleet purchasing patterns. Being
an early advocate of technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for example, places government
in a position as an environmental exemplar and advocate, in turn having flow on effects in terms of the
positive perception of this technology by the rest of the economy.

As well as encouraging partnerships between government and vehicle manufacturers from a fleet
perspective, Toyota Australia also encourages broader relationships, whether they be the
establishment of education programs and facilities informing the general public of vehicle technology
and driver behaviour, through joint technology road shows throughout Australia or other awareness
raising activities.

6. How federal, state and territory Governments could work together to support electric vehicle uptake and manufacturing, supply, and value
chain activities

Toyota Australia has been an active participant in the Federal Government’s Ministerial Forum on
Vehicle Emissions and we commend the government for taking this important step towards
addressing vehicle emissions. Toyota Australia strongly recommends a holistic approach towards the
development of a fuel efficiency standard and therefore requests that any mandated CO2 standard be
accompanied by improved fuel quality, Euro 6 regulations and a suite of complementary measures.
Toyota Australia is supportive of a mandatory CO2 standard that delivers the environmental benefits
required while allowing automotive manufacturers an adequate lead time to ensure consumer choice
is maintained.

### 6.1 Government fleet measures

Federal and state governments represent some of the largest fleet customers in Australia, purchasing
around 30,000 to 40,000 new vehicles per annum (2.7-3.6 per cent of new vehicles sales). While fleet
customers typically prioritise whole of vehicle costs in their purchasing decisions, government fleets
in particular often factor in additional selection criteria due to their broader economic and social
objectives. Preferential treatment for locally manufactured vehicles is an example of this.

With government in a position to be an exemplar in the environmental space and through its ability to
set the standard for fleet purchasing decisions more broadly, the public sector is in an ideal position to
demonstrate environmental leadership.

Governments can play a key role as an early adopter of new vehicle technology and their
accompanying infrastructure. This is demonstrated by the Victorian Government electric vehicle trial
in 2010-14, for which Toyota Australia provided four plug-in Prius vehicles. This program was
subsequently shifted to include both Melbourne and Sydney linking several councils, car-share
company GoGet and Toyota Australia.

It should be acknowledged that fit for purpose vehicles will continue to be needed within the
government fleet mix and this requirement should continue to be a leading factor in purchasing
decisions. While these vehicles may not consistently deliver optimal environmental outcomes, the
need for quality, durability and reliability for particular government agencies must remain a priority
where appropriate.

We recommend that the Federal Government implement the following measures to influence the
purchasing decisions of government fleet managers:

## 9

• Revisit the weighting placed against environmental outcomes versus other factors,
• • Consider reducing the age at which vehicle changeover occurs to accelerate the distribution of

Introduce a fuel efficiency target for government vehicle fleets; and

### modern low emission vehicles within the community.

A more fuel-efficient government fleet also has flow on benefits to purchasers of second hand
vehicles. The relatively higher turnover of fleet vehicles provides an injection of low and zero
emissions vehicles into the second-hand market, reducing the emissions of the Australian car park as
a whole.

## 6.2 Taxation measures

The reform of existing vehicle related taxes and charges presents a significant opportunity to
encourage the purchase of more efficient vehicles. Currently taxes applied at the national level in
particular are not designed with environmental outcomes as a leading factor. While there are
examples of state-based taxes and charges that are developed with vehicle emissions at their
forefront, these are applied inconsistently and the benefit provided is often insufficient to stimulate
vehicle demand.

## State-based taxes

In relation to state-based tax regimes, there are number of actions that can be implemented to
encourage the uptake of low emissions vehicles, however these cannot be considered in isolation. It is
clear that based on past or existing state-based practices, these measures alone will not be sufficient
to drive sales of environmentally friendly vehicles in a meaningful way. However, they are a part of a
holistic framework to progressively modify consumer purchasing behaviour and increase the
attractiveness of low emission vehicles.

On this basis, Toyota Australia supports many amendments to state taxes including:

• Stamp duty: This could be waived on a temporary or permanent basis for vehicles that meet
CO₂ emissions criteria to encourage the rapid take up of this technology (as per the ACT’s
Green Vehicle Scheme).

• Vehicle registration: This could be waived/reduced for low emission vehicles. For instance, the
Victorian Government’s $100 hybrid vehicle discount is a welcome measure in this space,
however the quantum of this concession may be deemed insufficient to drive hybrid sales in
isolation.

• User pays approach (based on fuel use – substitute for stamp duty/registration/third party
insurance): The environmental impact of motoring occurs due mainly to the use of vehicles,
rather than the ownership of vehicles. Therefore, the replacement of state taxes with a tax
based on usage, as represented by fuel purchase, would send a strong message of encouragement for environmentally friendly vehicles. Consideration should be given to
replacing state stamp duty, registration and third-party insurance charges with one state tax
on fuel sales.

### Replacement of the Luxury Car Tax

Toyota Australia supports the abolishment of the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) due to the discriminatory and
inequitable nature of this tax. However, if there is an ongoing revenue requirement, Toyota Australia
recommends that the LCT be replaced by a high emissions tax (HET) that is directed towards

## 10

supporting the Australian Government’s light vehicle environmental policy objectives such as
incentives for low emission vehicles and associated infrastructure.

A HET replacing the LCT should encourage behavioural change in purchasing decisions that
preference environmentally friendly vehicles. The HET could levy a charge on vehicles that are on the
higher end of the CO₂ spectrum for the particular vehicle category. This would have the effect of
encouraging the early introduction of new technology to the Australian market.

Alternatively, the replacement for the LCT could levy a charge on all vehicles which exceed the
average CO₂ emissions (calculated annually) for passenger, SUV and commercial vehicles. Allowance
would need to be made for those vehicles for use in mining, construction, agriculture and other
sectors which have a requirement for load bearing, emissions intensive types of vehicles.

As well as fuel efficiency, the replacement for the LCT should also consider additional concessions for
alternative fuel engines, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen fuel cell. This would facilitate a
holistic approach to transport emissions that tackles both CO2 and noxious emissions.

### Remaining Automotive Transformation Scheme Funding

The Automotive Transformation Scheme will run until the end of 2020, however with the end of local
manufacturing in 2017, the remaining funds could be allocated towards supporting the development
of zero emission vehicle infrastructure and consumer uptake of low and zero emission vehicles.

## 7. Conclusion

Toyota Australia appreciates the opportunity to make a submission to the Senate Select Committee
on Electric Vehicles and welcomes the opportunity to provide additional details on the
recommendations proposed.

As outlined above, zero emission vehicles have an important role to play in reducing economy-wide
emissions, however as evidenced by overseas, government support is an essential element of the
successful proliferation of these products, from both a supply and demand perspective.

We also reiterate the important role that hybrid vehicles play as an immediate solution to reducing
emissions without the requirement of infrastructure development. Toyota Australia urges the
Committee to take a technology neutral approach to zero emission vehicles and recognise that both
fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles will play an important role in a future zero
emission transport mix.

Finally, the next generation of zero emission vehicles will require significant infrastructure
investments, and cooperative partnerships between government and industry will be required to
facilitate the provision of this infrastructure. We would welcome the opportunity to work closely with
the Government in this area.

As stated in the introduction of this submission, Toyota has a global challenge to radically reduce new
vehicle CO₂ emissions but we cannot achieve this alone. We look forward to working collaboratively
with the Australian Government to achieve an environmentally friendly national vehicle fleet through
an integrated approach to emissions reduction.
