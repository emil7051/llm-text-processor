### 2024–25 Pre-Budget submission

Thank you for providing the Australian Dental Association (ADA) an opportunity
to share our views regarding
### priorities for the 2024–25 Budget.

Oral health is at the foundation of overall health, happiness, and quality of
life. People who have a healthy mouth
can eat, speak, and interact with others without experiencing discomfort or
shame. Despite advancements in
recent decades, more Australians have poor dental health than we would like.

Initiatives discussed herein would involve the investment of public funds, as
with any Budget proposal. However,
investment in oral health care is offset by reductions in health care costs
elsewhere. For example, in 2021–22,
about 78,800 hospitalisations for dental conditions could potentially have been
prevented with earlier treatment.1

### This submission focuses on opportunities to:
*
create a senior dental benefits scheme;
* enhance the child dental benefit scheme;
* adjust public dental services for adults funding arrangements; and
*

### consider the introduction of health savings accounts.

## About us

The ADA is the peak representative body for dentists in Australia. Our
17,000-plus members operate more than
7,500 small businesses. They include highly trained professionals who work
across the public and private sectors,
in general dental practice, or in one of 13 areas of dental specialisation, in
education and research roles, as well as
dentistry students currently completing their entry-to-practice qualification.

The primary objectives of the ADA are to encourage improvement of the oral and
general health of the public,
promote the ethics, art and science of dentistry, and support members to provide
safe, high-quality professional
## oral care.

Dentists are vital contributors to Australian public health. The importance lies
in their ability to treat and prevent
oral diseases and enhance overall well-being. By providing essential care and
services, dentists help their patients
maintain healthy teeth and gums, empowering them to eat, speak, and smile with
confidence. They are crucial in
diagnosing and treating oral diseases, which, if left untreated, can lead to
severe health issues and increase the

Select Committee into the Provision of and Access to Dental Services in
Australia

The recent publication of the Select Committee into the Provision of and Access
to Dental Services in Australia’s
final report presents an opportunity for the Government to carefully consider
that report’s recommendations and
look afresh at the most promising interventions to support the oral health of
all Australians.

The ADA supports several recommendations in the Select Committee’s final report.
We are always available to
advise on the areas in which we believe public investment will be most
impactful.

Please find following brief discussion of key initiatives that could be achieved
with the support of the Australian
## Government.

### Establish a Senior Dental Benefits Scheme

The cost of poor oral health for older Australians has been put at more than
$750 million per annum.2 Those aged
over 65 years accounted for around 13,791 potentially preventable
hospitalisations due to dental conditions in
## 2021-22.3

Recommendation 60 of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety is
to Establish a Senior Dental
Benefits Scheme (SDBS).4 The Government Response to the Royal Commission report
indicates that this
recommendation was subject to further consideration by 2023.5

In its submissions to the Royal Commission, the ADA outlined the need for a SDBS
and its benefits relative to
other models. The ADA is pleased the Royal Commission agreed with its proposed
alternative to funding oral care
for certain seniors, and hopes this recommendation will be followed through. The
introduction of such a scheme
is supported by stakeholders including the National Oral Health Alliance, the
Council of the Ageing, Consumers
### Health Forum, and National Seniors Australia.

A phased approach to introduction of a SDBS would allow the Government to
control expenditure. Key features of
the scheme would include:
* Provide individual aged care residents with access to oral and dental care up to set limits.

The SDBS should be established under the Dental Benefits Act 2008 so that rules
existing under the Child Dental
Benefits Schedule (CDBS) can be applied. Public and private dental service
providers are familiar with the
requirements of the CDBS and could therefore introduce services to this new
cohort efficiently. Compliance
measures existing under the CDBS could likewise be applied / extended
efficiently by Government.
* Support residential aged care staff.

Introduction of a SDBS should be supported by efforts to increase the oral
health literacy of care staff. This can be
achieved by including mandatory oral health units of study in the Certificate
III in Aged Care.

 Personal care staff are the backbone of care in residential facilities and the
front line of defence in avoiding oral
and dental issues. They require education and skills to ensure they can identify
oral health problems early, and
### manage them before the rot sets in.

Educational units already exist so no additional work is needed to develop them.
The ADA could work in
partnership to deliver any additional education required by staff who already
have a Certificate III in Aged Care
qualification.
* Teledentistry opportunities.

The ADA also proposes a telehealth solution that would ensure additional support
for care staff. Using a small
medical device that collects images/videos of resident’s mouths, the ADA could
support staff who believe there is
a dental issue impacting a resident’s ability to eat or drink. Through an online
platform, the digital image/video
(encrypted) could be sent to a dentist for review and the identification of
treatment needs determined.

The facility will then be alerted to the need to refer to a dentist for further
investigation with the cost of dental
being discussed with the resident, aged care provider and family and potentially
claimable through private health
insurance, or the SDBS (if established). The collection of images/videos should
take less than 10 minutes per
resident. The device would remain the property of the residential aged care
facility for ongoing use and work with
## any mobile phone.

The ADA can supply details around cost to Treasury or the Department of Health
on request.

### Enhance the Child Dental Benefit Schedule

The CDBS limit of up to $1,095 in benefits over a relevant two calendar year
period for basic dental services for
eligible children is generally sufficient to cover the cost of a regular
examination and recall program, which
promotes a preventative approach to oral health. However, it is not sufficient
to cover the cost of treatment for
children with more extensive treatment requirements. The ADA would therefore
support assessing the costs and
benefits of increasing the CDBS limit for high-risk children.
*

### Include hospital treatment.

CDBS benefits cannot be paid for any services provided in a hospital. For
children with extensive treatment needs
or who cannot tolerate treatment while awake, dental treatment may need to be
performed under general
anaesthesia (GA). This treatment is carried out in both public and private
hospitals.

Those attending private hospitals face substantial costs – covering hospital
stay costs, anaesthetist fees and
dental fees. While hospital and GA fees may be covered in part or fully by a
combination of Medicare and private
health insurance (if patients have it), dental fees in this scenario cannot be
covered or subsidised.

Enabling the CDBS to be used for in-hospital dental services, would broaden
access to these services. We
recommend extending the CDBS to cover the dental component of in-hospital
services.
*

### Include custom fabricated mouthguards.

Mouthguards are essential for children who engage in sporting and other leisure
activities that involve
heightened risk of oral trauma. The CDBS does not allow patients to access
funding to fabricate mouthguards. We
recommend the provision of custom-fitted mouthguards be included in the CDBS.
* Enhance access.

The CDBS attracted relatively low uptake following its initial
establishment—around 30% in the 2014 and 2015
calendar years—as compared to Health’s projections, resulting in a significant
underspend of allocated funding.

## ada.org.au












 The Australian National Audit Office recommended a focus on improved
communication with the target
## population.6

We understand this figure has improved to about 40% more recently, and consider
the CDBS could be better
promoted. It currently relies on dental practitioners, peak bodies and oral
health services for its promotion. It is
not widely advertised, and decision makers in some eligible families may not
understand it. We would value more
promotional activities such as promotion through schools and focus on
geographies where eligibility is
## underutilised.

Adjust Public Dental Services for Adults funding arrangements

For many years, states and territories have relied on additional funding to
support public dental care. This
funding, made available by the Commonwealth under a National Partnership
Agreement has been subject to
annual extensions, the ad hoc nature of which offers limited assurance to
delivery arms.

Feedback we have received suggests this practice tends to negatively affect
recruitment and retention of clinical
and administrative staff, particularly in rural and remote areas, because the
temporary funding means jobs are
not ongoing, which reduces job security, impacts staff eligibility for home
loans, etc.

We understand steps are underway to develop a federal funding agreement for oral
health which will bring some
stability to the funding agreements but the delay in finalising such an
agreement continues to limit the capacity of
states and territories to provide services to those who rely on public dental
care. We’d encourage this negotiation
be concluded expeditiously so that multi-year arrangements can be established.

Further, the Government should consider increasing the quantum of funding so
that more eligible Australians can
receive care without needing being put on a waiting list for extended periods of
time.

### Consider enabling Health Savings Accounts

The ADA released a report in 2018 titled Saving for Ones' Care – Understanding
how Health Savings Accounts can
help fund the health of Australians7, to provide fresh impetus for Government to
re-examine how health policy is
delivered in Australia. Commissioned by the ADA and prepared by the Centre for
International Economics, the
report proposes tax incentives which would allow Australians to save for their
own future dental and other health
## care spending.

By utilising tax deductibility to incentivise individuals to save for their
future ancillary health care spending,
Australians could be rewarded for proactively managing their health care funding
in a way that overcomes the
limitations of extras cover and retains their freedom of choice in which
practitioner they see.

It is expected that an average of $1,226 would be saved annually by Australians
because of the savings incentives.
The cost to the Australian Government of incentives designed for the purposes of
the review is estimated to be
### around $157 million in the first year.

It would be possible to tailor the tax incentive rate, for example, to focus on
helping those with income that may
disqualify them from receiving public dental care, but who may find it difficult
to afford some treatment in the
## private system.

 This might also encourage private health insurers to offer better value for
money, to compete with the alternative
### of health savings accounts.

## Conclusion

The ADA remains available to advise the Government on sustainable measures to
ensure our population has
access to appropriate oral health screening, prevention, and treatment. By
developing affordable and sustainable
oral health care models, the Australian Government can play a vital role in
supporting the nation’s oral health.
