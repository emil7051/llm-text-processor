### Dear Committee Secretary,

Please accept my submission into the Senate committee inquiry - Select Committee on
Electric Vehicles.

Australia is way behind many other countries in the adoption of EVs. Much of Europe,
the UK and even China are way ahead of Australia in the percentage of EVs on their
roads. This is a sad reflection of Australia.

When we look at Norway, the contrast becomes even more noticeable - Australia has
EVs sales of a mere fraction of 1% of total new car sales, however, in June 2018, Norway
achieved EVs sales of just over 50% of the total amount of new cars sold.

### Australia must do more to accelerate the transition to EVs.

### I wish to respond to the below Terms of Reference.

Term of Reference A: The potential economic, environmental and social benefits of
widespread electric vehicle uptake in Australia.

## Economic benefits

 The total cost of ownership of an electric car can be cheaper than an

internal combustion powered car. This will only become cheaper as more EV models flood the car market in the next few years, and as oil becomes
more limited and the cost of diesel and petrol fuel rises in coming years.

Electric VehiclesSubmission 13  Refueling an EV is already much cheaper than refueling a petrol or diesel
powered car - in some cases the cost of electricity can be almost as low as 50% of the cost of petrol.

 The more EVs available for sale on the Australian new vehicle market, the cheaper these EVs will become due to economies of scale, plus increased
competition from manufacturers further driving down EV prices.

## Environmental benefits

 The burning of petrol and diesel are known to contribute to climate change.
In contrast, a rapidly increasing percentage of Australia's electricity is now produced from sources that are 100% renewable - e.g. solar, wind, hydro,
biomass etc. This percentage is set to further rapidly increase with renewable energy projects currently approved or under construction, and
states with high renewable energy targets will only further increase. EVs running on electricity that is increasingly produced from renewable energy
sources, will drastically reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector.

## Social benefits

 Freeing Australia from the dependence on imported oil, especially

considering much of the world's oil is produced by countries that may be more prone to conflicts, which may negatively impact on Australia's long-
term ability to import oil.

 EVs powered by electricity that is increasingly and incrementally powered from 100% renewable energy sources, will reduce urban smog/pollution
levels, thereby reducing the impact of people suffering smog-related respiratory complaints on our public health system.

 EVs are much quieter then conventional cars, trucks and buses. Adoption of EVs - including in our bus and truck fleets - will reduce noise levels in not
only our cities, but also along major highways that dissect regional cities and towns across the country.

Term of Reference C: Measures to support the acceleration of electric vehicle uptake.

 Major expansion to the number of public rapid chargers for EVs.Currently

Australia only has some hundreds of public rapid chargers - however, many of these are owned by Tesla and they only allow Tesla users to charge their
vehicles at these superchargers. We need thousands of superchargers across the country to allow private citizens, government and private vehicle fleet
operators to tranbsition to EVs.

Electric VehiclesSubmission 13  All EV supershargers installed should be the latest generation technology

### using the fastest charge rate to allow ultra-fast charging.

 Government should enter partnerships with large oil companies to install EV supersharger networks at already established - as well as all future -
roadside service stations and roadhouses where motorists routinely stop to refuel their cars, trucks and buses.

 Governments (federal and states) to replace their fleet vehicles with EVs.
 Policies to assist/encourage private fleet operators - of not only cars, but

### also trucks and buses - to buy EVs.

###  Reduced stamp duty on EVs.
 Reduced registration fees on EVs.
 Reduced fringe benefits and luxury car tax on EVs.
 Strengthen Australia's vehicle emission regulations, so that EVs are more

### attractive to purchasers.

 Strengthen Australia's vehicle fuel efficiency regulations, so that EVs are

### more attractive to purchasers.

 The above measures will collectively make more consumers and fleet

operators consider buying EV. This will lead to an accelerated rate of EV sales in Australia, which will then lead to EV manufacturers selling a wider
range of EVs in Australia, including more entry level EVs. This will ultimately lead to a greater range of choice of EVs, and cheaper EVs, for
the Australian consumer.

## Sincerely

## Phil Browne
