(a) The potential economic, environmental and social benefits of widespread electric vehicle

## uptake in Australia.

The adoption of electric vehicles can deliver economic benefits if it is accompanied by decisive
government action to support electric vehicle manufacturing in Australia. A chance would be a fine
thing. Such support, if provided, would be a way for the governing class to begin to redress its
contribution to the destruction of the significant automotive industry that Australia used to have.

Australia lost its automotive industry because a succession of national governments, from the 1920s
until the present, comprehensively and continuously failed to devise and implement the industrial
policy measures needed to ensure the viability of the industry. With an industrial strategy similar to
that applied in Germany, France, Italy, Japan or Korea, Australia could have had a one million unit
per annum automotive industry, supporting one or two globally recognised firms and a few hundred
component suppliers providing jobs for two hundred thousand or more people.

Over the last thirty years, taxpayers stumped up billions of dollars as Danegeld to keep American
automotive firms in Australia. Enough was handed over to purchase a couple of global automotive
businesses outright. From the Button plan onwards, the American firms were never really interested
in staying here, a fact obvious to anyone able to divine the owners’ real intent by looking at the
condition of their plants and the products they offered. When Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott indicated
that they were not really interested in them staying here either, they left.

All of that treasure, all of that industrial experience, all of those supplier businesses, all of the jobs,
skills and capabilities, a hundred years in the making, tossed away with nothing to show for it. In the
catalogue of bungled Australian industry policies, a pretty long list to be sure, the loss of the
automotive industry will rank as one of the most egregious failures of the responsible class of
politicians, advisers and bureaucrats whose duty to the nation was not served.

Electric vehicle production could provide an opportunity to recover that which was lost. A revived
industry producing, but not confined to electric vehicles, could begin the reinstatement of the
technical, industrial economic, technical and industrial benefits that the nation formerly had.

Nations with common sense highly value automotive manufacturing, because it is an industry that
engages a broad range of advanced productive activities and, in terms of technical complexity,
quality and productivity, practices them at the deepest and most demanding level.

As recently as the 1980s, when the process of “economic reform” was unleashed on the industry,
Australia assembled, or fully built, 83% of the vehicles sold in the domestic market. With the industry
gone, Australia now imports the lot, at a cost of about 2% of GDP. To put the cost of this loss into
context, Australian automotive imports now entail the gifting of tens of thousands of jobs, valuable
technical skills, hard won industrial capabilities and profitable business opportunities to foreigners.
Paying for these imports requires an outlay of foreign currency equal to more than half of the total
farm gate value of production of the entire agricultural sector of Australia. If, on the business as
usual model fashioned by Canberra’s neo-Ricardians, electric cars are going to be just a subset of the
1.2 million motor vehicles now imported to Australia, then there will be no economic benefit from
their adoption at all.

Despite the passionate claims of their boosters, the environmental benefits of electric cars are not
particularly significant. Purely electric vehicles do not emit carbon dioxide when driven, but charging
their batteries requires the production of electricity elsewhere. In heavily congested cities, like those

Electric VehiclesSubmission 7 in China, electric vehicles have the considerable benefit of moving exhaust pollution to somewhere
else, but this is not a major issue for most of Australia.

Advocates of electric cars argue that the electricity required for battery charging can be produced by
renewable energy. The problem with this argument is that the contribution of renewables to the
Australian energy budget is small and, given the inherent limitations of solar and wind power, and
despite the prodigious investments in them, likely to remain so. In the 2017 calendar year, a total of
259,446 GWh of electrical energy was produced in Australia, 220,359 GWh of which was generated
from burning hydrocarbons. Coal accounted for 72% of the hydrocarbon share, with natural gas and
oil providing the balance. Of the total electrical energy output of Australia in 2017, wind and solar,
despite the billions of dollars expended in their deployment, contributed a mere 8.3% .

Electric cars are more efficient than cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs). Electric
traction motors operate at energy input/output efficiencies in the 90-95% range and the charging
and discharging efficiencies of modern li-ion batteries are very high. As a result, an electric vehicle
powertrain can be three or more times more efficient than an ICE powered vehicle; these manage,
at best, an input/output efficiency of 25-30%.

The problem for electric cars is that the energy required to charge their batteries will most likely be
produced by a thermal power station. Although the input/output efficiency of the power station is
higher than an ICE powered motor vehicle, because large heat engines have higher thermodynamic
efficiencies than small heat engines, the sum of all other losses must be taken into account.

For example, if the electric car is being charged and used in Melbourne, the energy will likely be
derived from burning lignite in the La Trobe Valley. Loy Yang, the biggest power station, has an
input/output energy efficiency of about 33%; better than an ICE, but not by much. Subsequent
losses are incurred at various stages between the power station and the electric vehicle; step-up
transformer losses between the generator and transmission line, transmission losses between the
La Trobe Valley and Melbourne, step-down transformer losses, and further losses in distribution
transformers and cables to the vehicle charging point. Taken together, these can account for 10% or
more of the energy produced at the generator. On top of that, the electric car has charging and
discharging losses in cycling the battery plus inverter and motor losses during operation. The end
result is that the electric vehicle will have a net input/output efficiency, when considering the whole
energy cycle, of about 27%; much the same as an ICE powered vehicle.

It may be argued that as only 85% of Australia’s electrical energy is supplied by non-renewable
means, electric vehicles can still be justified because they may, at least in part, be fuelled from non-
carbon dioxide emitting sources. This argument fails, however, because most Australian electricity
(72% of the 85%) is produced from coal. Coal emits much more carbon dioxide per energy unit than
does petrol or diesel.

What cars powered by ICEs and thermal power stations have in common is that they are both
devices for converting chemical energy into shaft work. They do this by initiating a chemical reaction
(oxidation), between a hydrocarbon compound, carried in the vehicle fuel tank or supplied to the
boiler or gas turbine of a power station, and oxygen, which is appropriated from the atmospheric
commons, as follows:

### CxHy + { x +y/4 }O2 -> xCO2 + y/2 H2O

The products of this reaction are carbon dioxide, water and heat. Heat is the measure of the binding
energy released by the molecular reformulation of the initial hydrogen/carbon compound into

Electric VehiclesSubmission 7 carbon dioxide and water. The heat is subsequently applied via a thermodynamic process in an
engine or turbine to produce shaft motion.

In the chemical equation for the complete combustion of a hydrocarbon shown above, the quantity
of carbon dioxide produced depends on the ratio of carbon (x) to hydrogen (y) in the fuel source;
generally, the more complex the hydrocarbon molecule, the higher the carbon component and, as a
consequence, the higher the proportion of carbon dioxide produced by combustion. Burning
methane (CH4), the main constituent of natural gas, will produce the least carbon dioxide. Petrol
(approximately C8H18) will produce more for the same energy yield. Coal is the most complex
molecule; burning high grade anthracite (C240H90O4NS) produces the highest carbon dioxide
emissions per energy unit of any of the hydrocarbon fuels.

Using petrol as a base, the quantity combusted to produce 100kg of carbon dioxide would, if
substituted for methane for the same energy yield, produce 74kg of carbon dioxide. Substituting
anthracite, the same energy yield would produce 145kg of carbon dioxide.

Given the current Australian energy production mix, measured by what is actually delivered rather
than by the theoretical installed capacity, and considering the entire energy cycle of electric vehicles,
the electrification of the national vehicle fleet would have little effect on carbon dioxide emissions.

Massive expansion of wind and solar capacity may improve the environmental benefits of vehicle
electrification, but Australians are already becoming disenchanted with the high cost and inherent
unreliability of renewables. Energy at hand is an excellent metric of prosperity, and the coal, oil and
gas currently used in Australia provides a gross yield of about 900MJ per capita per day. Renewables
will have trouble producing anywhere near that. Environmentalists argue that we should all be using
less energy, which is an indirect way of saying that we should all become poorer. Australians should
use energy efficiently and, while there is always room for improvement, mostly they already do.

The best way of further electrifying the economy, including transportation, while maintaining our
standard of living and reducing carbon dioxide emissions, is by replacing coal-fired power generation
with nuclear power stations. Unlike renewables, which already operate at close to their maximum
potential efficiency, nuclear power has enormous scope for energy productivity improvement.

(b) Opportunities for electric vehicle manufacturing and electric vehicle supply and value chain

### services in Australia, and related economic benefits.

Until recently, the Australian economy had available to it most of the technical and industrial skills,
together with the production facilities, needed to design, develop and manufacture motor vehicles,
including electric-powered models. The closure of the industry means that this is no longer the case.
The former plants have been dismantled and relocated abroad, the supplier base substantially shut
down or diminished and the technical skills dispersed.

These industry capabilities could still be re-assembled with a will to do so but this will become
increasingly difficult with the passage of time. Any attempt to revive conventional vehicle
manufacturing would require a prodigious effort, large investments and serious government
commitment to the venture as an important national project.

Every cloud has a silver lining, however, and, in one sense, the loss of the old industry presents an
opportunity to envisage a new and better one. Valuable as it was, the old industry had many defects,
entrenched in long established structures and techniques and, by being foreign owned at the peak

assembly level, was always subject to the operating principles and procedures of the global entities
of which it was a part. Foreign ownership shaped the Australian industry as an essentially “colonial”
operation, severely limiting its scope and freedom of action, in design, engineering, organisational
form, choice of production technology, product mix and authority to adopt an export orientation.

A major aspect of this structure was that the Australian plants, as subsidiaries of global firms, built
products in accordance with standard industry high-volume automotive manufacturing techniques.
Based on unibody construction, these techniques were appropriate for markets where the required
scale economies, more than 40,000 annual units per model, were achievable. With market opening
and increased consumer choice in Australia, these volumes were seldom achieved or maintained
over a whole model cycle.

The solution would have been to export the major part of the plant’s output This is what Toyota did
with the Camry and was the reason that the Japanese company would have stayed on had Holden
been retained. The American firms demurred on allowing significant Australian exports, however.
Permission to export was rarely given and then only in a desultory manner and as a response to
pressure. Corporate political intrigues then conspired to limit any chance of success for such
ventures, by shunting the distribution of Australian cars off to dying brands like Mercury or Pontiac
or starving Chevrolet dealers of inventory in the case of the excellent SS (Commodore).

The reason for American reticence was that they took a more hard-headed view of their Australian
businesses. They never really wanted them in the first place, were here because of tariffs and when
these finished wanted to go back to their preferred model of full importation. The Australian market
was small, remote and its human factor inputs were an order of magnitude more expensive than in
Asia. It wasn’t that cars couldn’t be produced and shipped profitably from Australia, given full plant
utilisation, rather that they could be built and shipped much more profitably from somewhere else.

The Australian Productivity Council (APC) did a fair amount of work on addressing this problem by
envisaging what an Australian automotive business could look like in a post Ford/GM/Toyota
industry. The essence of the APC approach was to develop a business concept better suited to
Australian cost and market volume realities than the one that had been in place. This concept was
based on the view that an Australian industry needed a way of designing, building and selling cars
that could make substantial margins on much smaller model volumes than those needed by
conventional production methods. The business concept had three main features.

Firstly, it proposed a way of building cars on a common flexible platform (CFP) to substantially
reduce initial development and tooling cost per model at the expense of a higher base unit cost.
Trading up-front costs against unit costs in this way would provide better production economies,
more variety and shorter model cycle times at all volumes below 40,000 annual units than the
conventional manufacturing methods.

Secondly, the business proposed a different plant format, similar to production concepts developed
by Volvo at Uddevalla in Sweden, as an alternative to the Toyota Production System (TPS). The
proposed plant design had fixed assembly stations as distinct from a moving assembly line with part
sets delivered sequentially to the workspace for assembly by a skilled two-person team completing
one vehicle per shift. Such a plant is much less expensive to build, is more flexible, offers higher
worker morale and a flatter, less expensive, management structure than a conventional plant.

Thirdly, the business proposed a direct-selling model from a digital platform supported by company-
owned sites in shopping centres, a model subsequently demonstrated by Tesla in Australia. This
would collapse the dealer margin into the producing business and enable solid profit margins,

budgeted at 30%, providing rapid growth through retained earnings while offering customers an
ultra high quality product at a reasonable price.

Taken together, this business model would enable viable vehicle production in Australia at feasible
sales volumes. Although the external appearance of the proposed models was similar to premium
vehicles built by conventional techniques, the structural underpinnings were quite different; space
frame construction was envisaged rather than unibody and light metals and/or composites were to
be used in place of steel.

At the time this work was undertaken the product concept assumed the use of conventional ICE
powertrains to be sourced from a European supplier. The Australian manufactured componentry
was confined, at least in the beginning, to the modular base unit, body closures, glass and interior
parts. At that time, electric cars were less developed and were not considered to be as appealing to
potential customers. That situation has now changed; electric cars are steadily becoming more
acceptable due to steady improvements in the production cost, energy density, durability and
charging time of batteries.

The business model proposed by the APC would be ideally suited to electric vehicle production, in
fact it would be a more straightforward project because the development work, particularly in noise,
vibration, harshness (NVH) is simpler and less expensive with electric vehicles than with ICE powered
designs. More than that, the electric vehicle industry is evolving along lines that simplify supplier
issues for emergent vehicle assemblers.

We would be happy to discuss the proposed production model with an interested party.

( c ) Measures to support the acceleration of electric vehicle uptake.

The uptake of electric vehicles has been very slow in Australia to date. There are three obvious
reasons for this; electric cars are expensive, they are not yet seen as effective substitutes for ICE
powered vehicles and they are not what people who purchase motor vehicles are used to.

Electric cars are expensive because the batteries used to power them are expensive. Not only are
the batteries expensive, their service life is limited as well. Although the performance of an ICE
powered vehicle falls off with wear, this is barely noticeable, gradual and occurs only at very high
mileages. Batteries, on the other hand, degrade with each recharge and the rate of degradation
increases if the battery is recharged too quickly; fast charging li-ion batteries reduces their service
life considerably. Electric vehicle owners are also faced with an expensive battery replacement bill
after several years of ownership; an outlay that may be difficult to justify in view of the general
dilapidation and depreciation of the rest of the vehicle.

Electric vehicles are not yet considered effective substitutes for ICE powered vehicles because of
range and convenience issues. Batteries are heavy and, compared to petrol, have a very low energy
density. For example, the polyethylene fuel tank of a Toyota Corolla, filled to capacity with 55 litres
of petrol, weighs about 50 kg. The energy yield of this fuel load, at 45MJ per litre, is 687.5kWh. In
contrast, the 85kWh Tesla Model S battery weighs 540kg. Electric motor efficiency mitigates in
favour of the battery, but electric vehicles are still disadvantaged under real world operating
conditions. Claimed electric vehicle endurance may look impressive, assuming a steady speed, on
level ground with the ancillaries turned off. However, acceleration, overtaking, hill climbing and
turning on the air-conditioner will attenuate the range sharply. Recharging a battery takes much

longer than refuelling an ICE car; 9.5 hours for a Tesla battery on a domestic 240v supply, reducing
to 75 minutes on a Tesla Supercharger.

In favour of electric vehicles is that battery technology is improving rapidly; energy density
has doubled over the last twenty years and may double again in the next twenty. Electric vehicle
range issues are becoming less of an issue as newer batteries become available. In any case, for most
users in urban areas the range of existing models is entirely adequate, requiring only a slight change
in management practices to maintain full vehicle availability; similar to managing the battery of a
mobile device or laptop computer.

For long range users, promising technologies, like petrol-powered range extenders, are in prospect.
The newest designs envisage compact, mechanically simple linear reciprocating motor/generators
that are able to steadily maintain battery charge from an onboard hydrocarbon fuel supply, when
required, by operating in series hybrid form. Such designs will offer full electric operation when
battery charge is available and an unlimited range, with occasional fuel stops, when it is not.

Electric vehicles have many driving benefits. They are smooth and quiet. They have seamless
acceleration because electric motors, unlike ICEs, deliver full torque at start. They are mechanically
durable as well; induction motors have one rotating part and can easily last for 30,000 hours or
more, perhaps two million kilometres before needing repair or replacement. By comparison, ICEs
have a cacophony of whirling and reciprocating parts, high internal stresses, vibration, balancing
issues and large destructive forces to contend with. The Otto cycle engine dates from the middle of
the nineteenth century. That it has survived as long as it has, and performed as well, despite its
inherent defects, is a testament to the extraordinary talents of the engineers that have continuously
developed it. So far, it has seen off all previous challengers because, to paraphrase Winston
Churchill’s comment on democracy, it is the worst form of engine imaginable, except for all of the
others. Its situation today is more precarious, however, positioned like the huge reciprocating triple
expansion steam engines of the 1890s; engineering masterpieces about to be pole-axed by the
Parsons steam turbine. If battery producers get their costs down, their energy density up and their
lifetime extended, the ICE, for most vehicle applications at least, could soon pass into history.

Left to the market, electric vehicles will steadily increase their market share, based not on regulation
or government compulsion, as favoured by many environmentalists, but by the real, and increasing,
list of benefits that they offer.

It is up to electric vehicle manufacturers to make the case for them. In the past, the case has been
weak. The automotive market has seen them before; in the early years of automotive transport,
battery electric vehicles were popular until the greater convenience of ICE alternatives drove them
from the market. On present trends, their return could produce a different outcome. Australian
governments should take an interest in getting cars manufactured in Australia again, but they should
not take sides in trying to choose the timing for a change in propulsion technology.

(d) Measures to attract electric vehicle manufacturing and electric vehicle supply and value chain
manufacturing to Australia.

If there is one lesson Australians should learn from the failure of the previous automotive industry, it
is that less effort should be spent on attracting investment from foreign sources and more on raising
it domestically; at the same time making sure that any strategically important businesses formed in
Australia are effectively defended against foreign predation.

At the dawn of the automotive age Australia was well positioned to harvest the enormous economic
benefits made available by the new transportation and production technologies. The previous road
transportation technology, mainly horse-drawn vehicles, supported an extensive array of crafts and
businesses in town and country. The wheelwrights, farriers, harness and saddle makers, blacksmiths,
carriage builders and feed and grain merchants of Australia employed tens of thousands of people.
The emergent automotive age would soon clear all of that away.

Australians made a good start in the automotive business. Unsurprisingly, a set of colonies founded
by, and populated from, the leading technological and economic power of the nineteenth century,
possessed many capable engineers and craftsmen. Harley Tarrant, the best of the early Australian
motor manufactures, built complete motor cars in Melbourne between 1900 and 1907. A preserved
example, a 1905 roadster, is on display at the RACV headquarters in Melbourne. Tarrant cars were
outstanding examples of the technology of the period. An examination of cars produced by Tarrant’s
European contemporaries, as displayed at Beaulieu, Hampshire, or the Musee de Arts et Metiers in
Paris, demonstrates that the Tarrant stands up exceptionally well; state of the art for the period,
well-engineered and beautifully made.

The problem for Tarrant, and others like him, was that Australian manufacturing at that time,
although highly capable, was generally small scale and labour intensive. This structure, given high
Australian wages, made local products too expensive. In addition, Australia had no interchangeable
part manufacturing capability available to support automotive production until the 1930s and could
not, therefore, attempt the production of engines, gearboxes and axles on a cost-effective basis.

Instead, the industry began by building car bodies; a natural extension of the carriage building trade.
By the late 1920s, the most successful firm, Holden Motor Body Builders (HMBB) in Adelaide
employed 3000 people and was building nearly 50,000 bodies a year. It was the largest body-
building firm in the world outside of North America.

National governments around the world were keen to ensure that their domestic businesses would
find a place in the new order. The problem was the Americans. In the early twentieth century the
United States was emerging from a long period of protectionist nation-building. It had the largest
domestic market for automobiles by far. It had developed new and more efficient management
techniques. Above all, it had perfected, after more than a century of innovation, trial and error and
practice, the “American System”; the ability to produce interchangeable parts. It was this formidable
manufacturing innovation that changed the industrial world and powered American hegemony to its
consolidation at the end of the Second World War. No-one else could compete against that.

National governments, wiser than our own, took whatever steps that were needed to push the
Americans to the margins of their markets, to make room for their own ventures. Every tactic was
used. In France it was prohibitive tariffs; up to 220%. In Germany, a state-financed clean-sheet
business, Volkswagen, was set up. In Italy, the foreigners, Citroen and Ford, were booted out. In
Japan, a 1936 law was passed to limit the production of American firms, while channelling funds and
supply contracts to local businesses. The Japanese policy was the most draconian. In 1934, American
firms held more than 90% of the market but by 1939 they were gone. Ford and General Motors were
driven out and Toyota, Nissan and Isuzu were pushed to the fore.

Australian governments were asleep at the wheel during this period. The problems began when
HMBB built a modern plant at Woodville in 1924. General Motors, then importing chassis and fitting
them with Australian made bodies, moved to contract for the entire output of the Woodville plant
for a three-year period. HMBB used to supply everybody, including Ford, with bodies. The contract

with General Motors alarmed Ford. It worried that its major competitor, by procuring the entire
output of Australia’s best body plant, would be acting to the detriment of the company’s interests.
Ford’s response was to send an executive of its Canadian subsidiary, Hubert C. French, to Australia to
assess the situation. French’s report advocated the construction of a body and assembly plant at
Geelong as a remedy. The Ford plant at Corio was constructed in 1925, with French (who spent the
rest of his life in Australia) in charge. This development, in turn, concerned General Motors. When
HMBB fell on hard times in 1931, in large part because it had shaped its plant to meet the needs of
General Motors, the American company, following a similar policy to that it had applied to solve its
principal agent issues with Fisher Body in 1919, acquired the Australian business.

As a result of the establishment of Ford in Geelong and the acquisition of HMBB by General Motors,
all several years before Australia was ready to commence full automotive mass production, future
control of the commanding heights of the industry was ceded to the two major American firms.

It was at this point that the Commonwealth government should have intervened to secure a
dominant position for a local firm, as all of the other national governments who took their industrial
structure seriously had done. There was an attempt by the pre-war Menzies government to do
something, opposed by the Country Party and the Tariff Board, an organisation that has maintained
an animus of Balkan intensity against automotive manufacturing throughout all of its subsequent
iterations. The Menzies plan disappeared with the outbreak of war in 1939. In 1944, the Curtin
government revisited the issue, but chose General Motors to lead Australia into full scale
automotive mass production instead; an easy and safe decision to make then, but a decision that
confined the industry to stasis and under-performance for the duration of its existence. General
Motors was not interested in making Holden into a world brand; it had plenty of those already. It
was not interested in allowing exports either; cars could be produced more cheaply elsewhere.

Foreign investment and ownership is neither good nor bad; it depends on what it’s for. An American
company owning a chain of hamburger restaurants in Australia is a matter of no importance; a
restaurant chain is not a strategically important industry. Australian firms are free to compete in the
market and, because the barriers to entry are low, they do. An American owned motor industry is an
entirely different thing. The historical presence of American automotive firms, in any nation trying to
establish an industry of its own, always worked to suppress that opportunity; they were too big, too
rich, too good at mass production and too determined to reduce all competitors to ruin to be given
free rein.

For most of the twentieth century, Australia followed the entirely commendable policy of imposing
protective tariffs and quotas on imports; the standard road to development that every late-starting
nation choosing to industrialise needs to follow. The problem was that, having taken steps to foster
the development of local industries, Australian governments allowed the very firms they needed to
exclude, at least until a local industry had found its feet, to jump the tariff wall and set up operations
on Australian territory.

To ask the question of how investments may be attracted to resume an industry in a new form is to
presume that foreigners should be expected to invest in businesses that Australians are not willing
to invest in for themselves. If the governing class thinks that attracting foreign investment is the best
way to reconstitute an important Australian industry, then it will indicate that it has learned nothing
at all from the past. If Australia is to have a successful automotive industry it needs to build it up for
itself, with domestic savings for capital and with secure local ownership and skills. Government
policy needs to make sure that happens.

(e) How federal, state and territory governments could work together to support electric vehicle
uptake and manufacturing, supply, and value chain activities.

The loss of the domestic automotive manufacturing industry is probably the most serious failure of
Australian industry policy of the last fifty years. It is worth speculating as to what alternative policy a
national government more serious about retaining and expanding such an important industry might
have pursued. Perhaps something along the lines of the following:

When General Motors finally stated its intention to cease local production, the Abbott government
should have quickly moved to acquire the Holden business, with fair compensation, and negotiated
an agreement for the continued use of the company’s designs and component suppliers until
substitutes could be developed or acquired from other sources. Peugeot made such an arrangement
following its recent acquisition of Opel, General Motors’ German business.

Funding should then have been provided for the re-acquired Australian firm to redevelop and extend
its product range to enable it to rebuild its sales volume. Holden would have been freed
from the technical and product development distortions, and business development limitations,
imposed on it as a part of a global business operating under a strategy hostile to Australian interests.

The national government should then have taken steps to ensure that the new Australian firm,
which it had underwritten, secured a nominated domestic market share of, say, 30% within ten
years, by voluntary restraint agreements with importers in the first instance, backed up by the
credible threat of import regulation in the case of non-cooperation.

Range extension, beyond the scope of the Australian firm to develop economically, could have been
introduced via cooperation with a foreign partner interested in reciprocally acquiring cars of the
type that the Australian firm could build. There are plenty of potential partners in Asia and Europe
who would be amenable to this.

The Abbott government should have simultaneously enjoined Toyota to stay in Australia and moved
to prevent other firms from establishing local assembly operations, as a way of circumventing import
controls, until such time as the economies of scale needed by the incumbents were not put at risk by
the establishment of new facilities.

A small automotive industry authority, outside of Canberra and the public service, should have been
set up to monitor and report on the performance of the Australian industry, strictly on the relevant
technical metrics; productivity, profitability, design and engineering competence, technological
status and comparative quality performance.

The above are actions of the sort undertaken by national governments that take industrial policy
seriously. The Abbott government failed to follow a course like this, either because it did not think
the industry important enough or, by putting its faith in the opinions of the usual claque of economic
ideologues that the governing class relies on, believed the automotive industry to be a lost cause.

The answer to the question of how governments can assist in getting Australia’s new and existing
manufacturing industries working properly is for the national government to get its industry policy
act together, for that is where the main problems lie.

Despite promising beginnings at Federation, Australian governments have conspired to bungle one
industrial opportunity after another; automotive manufacturing, aircraft production, machine tools
and production equipment, agricultural and mining machinery, locomotive construction, naval

vessels and submarines. Businesses in all of these industries have been started and built up, their
skills laboriously developed, their capabilities mastered, only to be squandered or tossed away
because Australian governments failed to take charge of the issues that only a national government
can act upon; what sort of industries are worthy of support, how many firms should operate in a
sector where scale is important, how can trade unions, public bodies and firms be held to account on
productivity and how should the nation react to the predations of Asian mercantilism.

In the middle 1950s nearly 30% of Australian GDP was derived from manufacturing. The nation was
economically balanced, it employed everyone who needed to work, it paid its way in the world and
was not overburdened by bloated government. Today, manufacturing is down to about 6% of GDP, a
level commensurate only with that of a Caribbean tax haven or a no-hoper failed state in Africa. As a
result, the nation has high unemployment, a fragile current account, a narrowly based economy at
risk of external shocks, a debased technical capability and a government that confiscates twice as
much as a share of GDP than it did in the 1960s. It’s time to start doing things differently.
