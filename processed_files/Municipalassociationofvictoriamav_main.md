## Introduction

The Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the
Senate Select Committee’s inquiry into electric vehicles (EVs).

The MAV is the statutory peak body for local government in Victoria. Formed in 1879, we have
a long and proud tradition of supporting councils to provide good government to their
communities. We represent all Victorian councils and work to advance the interests of the
local government sector as a whole.

to assist with a smooth and efficient transition to EVs it is important that the
Commonwealth and state governments work closely with councils. Commonwealth and state
governments must also work together to ensure a coordinated approach is taken, and that the
appropriate policies and incentives are in place, particularly to support councils.

While EVs currently make up a very small percentage of the vehicle market in Australia, there is
a growing consensus, including amongst Victorian councils, that widespread uptake of EVs
across Australia is both inevitable and desirable. The United Kingdom, France, Norway, the
Netherlands, Germany and China are just a few of the countries that have announced that they
will ban new diesel and petrol cars or are considering doing so. Bloomberg New Energy Finance
estimates that EVs will account for 54 per cent of all new light-duty vehicle sales globally by
2040.

This submission draws on recent reports and studies by a range of parties, including those
prepared by the Australia Institute1 and by ClimateWorks Australia2 in partnership with the
Electric Vehicle Council.

As road infrastructure providers, fleet managers and representatives of their local communities,
Victorian councils have a strong interest in supporting a smooth transition to EVs. many
councils have already or are currently considering investing in EVs and EV charging
infrastructure as part of broader objectives to reduce emissions, improve air quality, protect and
enhance local amenity, and reduce lifecycle fleet maintenance costs. With fleet emissions
making up a significant proportion of councils’ overall corporate emissions, councils recognise a
transition to EVs powered by clean energy as a positive step to advance councils’ emissions
reduction objectives.

The MAV recognises that we are in a state of climate emergency that requires urgent action by
all levels of government. Noting that light vehicles account for 10 per cent of Australia’s total
greenhouse gas emissions, we consider a transition away from internal combustion engine
vehicles to EVs to be one of many necessary actions to reduce emissions.

The potential economic, environmental and social benefits of widespread EV uptake in Australia

The potential benefits of widespread uptake of EV in Australia and Victoria are many and
include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and reduced noise and
amenity impacts. According to SGS Economics & Planning, the lack of incentives and
encouragement for EV uptake in Australia and the resulting low adoption of EVs will cost
Australia `several billions of dollars per year’ because these benefits won’t have been able to be
realised3.

We note that the reduced emissions benefits from EVs would be maximised if charging stations
were able to rely wholly, or even partly, on clean energy. Victorian councils are strong
supporters of renewable energy and we encourage the State, the EV industry and electricity
providers to support the development, installation and use of clean energy-dependent EV
charging infrastructure wherever possible.

EVs may also deliver benefits in terms of management of peak demand and avoiding costly
upgrades to the power grid. A recent study in Denmark found that EVs can work as mobile
energy storage units, thereby providing flexibility for the grid to respond to supply and demand4.
Nissan in partnership with Ovo, an energy supplier in the United Kingdom, will reportedly be
offering a “vehicle-to-grid” service to purchasers of Nissan’s new Leaf EV next year.

An additional potential benefit from widespread uptake of EVs in Victoria not mentioned in the
terms of reference is economic stimulus, via possible cost savings to business (especially
businesses centred on service delivery vehicles) and also employment opportunities including in
research and development, and manufacturing. Job losses in industries such as service stations
and mechanical labour will almost certainly occur as EV uptake increases. Investment in training
that target EV-associated opportunities will be important.

It is perhaps worth noting that a mere switch from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs
does nothing to address traffic congestion which already costs the Victorian economy billions of
dollars each year in lost productivity. Private motor vehicles still present many issues
including a safety risk to people walking and riding bikes, are space-intensive and delay trams
and buses across the road network. According to the Victorian Government’s `Victoria in Future
2016: population and household projections to 2051’, the population of Victoria is projected to
grow to 7.7 million by 2031, and to 10.1 million by 2051. Greater Melbourne is projected to have
almost 85 per cent of the state’s growth, with the population projected to increase to 8 million in
2051.

2017.

While we recognise that large-scale adoption of EVs will deliver many benefits, we
remain of the view that a mass mode shift from private road transport to public transport and,
where possible, to cycling and walking, is essential. A truly integrated transport network that
does not rely on individuals’ privately owned road vehicles should be a Victorian Government
priority objective.

The most recent motor vehicle census data indicates that the number of registered vehicles in
Victoria increased by 2.5 per cent to close to 4.8 million vehicles between 2016 and 20175.
Genuine long term integrated transport and land use planning and substantial investment in
public transport infrastructure is critical if Victoria is to remain liveable and prosperous. Electric
vehicles, especially electric heavy vehicles and electric public transport fleet, will and should be
a key component of Victoria’s integrated transport future.

### Measures to support the acceleration of EV uptake

Research by ClimateWorks indicates that the key barriers to uptake of EVs are cost and
availability, recharging concerns, and consumer awareness. Councils also consider these
issues to be the key barriers in addition to concerns about restricted travel range.

In relation to cost and availability, it is anticipated that the offering of a wider variety of EV
models in the Australian market, particularly at a lower price point, would increase sales. In
2016 there were only three models of EV that were priced less than $60,000 and two of these
were no longer available by mid-year. The third was a van only available through special order.

In terms of regulatory and economic incentives we note the options suggested by ClimateWorks, the Electric Vehicles Council and others, including:

introduction of more stringent light vehicle carbon dioxide emissions standards 
removing or discounting the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) applicable to EVs  removing fringe benefits tax for EVs
incorporation of EVs into government fleets; and  support for the installation of an EV charging network.

Experience in many overseas jurisdictions shows that the provision of incentives can and
does lead to increased uptake of EVs. Successful incentives identified by the Australia Institute
include federal tax credits in the US, the bonus-malus system in France (whereby buyers of
high-emitting vehicles pay a fee and buyers of low-emissions vehicles receive a rebate), and EV
exemptions from road tolls, registration charges and VAT in Norway. We encourage the
Committee to study the measures and policy frameworks adopted in the likes of Norway, the US
and most recently in New Zealand, and consider their applicability in the Victorian and
Australian context.

In regards to infrastructure incentives, the provision of an easily accessible, efficient and reliable
charging network will be critical to bolster consumer confidence in EVs. ClimateWorks has
found that despite research indicating that most charging will occur at home or in the workplace,

5 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Motor Vehicle Census Data, Australia, 31 Jan 2017.

potential purchasers of EVs still tend to seek assurance that public charging infrastructure will
also be readily available.

Again, it is instructive to look at how other jurisdictions have incentivised provision of public
charging infrastructure. The Australia Institute nominates New Hampshire’s approach of
providing targeted state rebates for installation of public EV charging stations in non-residential
properties as a possible right fit for Australia. In their view, the current fragmentation of charging
technology heightens the need for government intervention to help ensure heterogeneous
charging stations are available in strategic locations across all areas.

Councils are already concerned about the dominance of one EV manufacturer’s charging
infrastructure in Victoria and are keen to see multiple providers in the market and for charge
points to be accessible to all EVs. It would be a poor outcome indeed to find ourselves with one
monopoly provider of EVs or EV charging infrastructure and for there not to be a smart spread
of charging stations to enable EV travel across all regions of Victoria.

Rural councils in particular are concerned that the distance between charge points not be too
great to prevent or deter EV travel to and across rural Victoria. In providing input to this
submission, East Gippsland Shire Council, Victoria’s second largest municipality in land size,
noted that there is currently no public charging infrastructure within the shire and only one
commercial premises that offers a charge point for Tesla vehicles only. This lack of charging
infrastructure clearly needs to be addressed if potential purchasers and drivers of EVs are to
have confidence that EVs are a good and sensible vehicle option in Victoria. Government
regulation and incentives have a role to play.

Confidence in EVs would also likely be boosted if there was a centralised database or map of all
charging points that is clear, easily accessible and kept current. Standardised signage for public
charging points would also likely be beneficial. The importance of public charging infrastructure
being accompanied with EV-only parking spaces adjacent to the infrastructure has also been
raised by councils.

Consumer awareness of and appreciation for EVs will no doubt improve when there is a plentiful
supply of EVs on our roads. to reach that point however, governments have an
important role to play in educating the public and promoting the benefits of EVs. We note that as
part of a multi-faceted package to support EVs in New Zealand, the New Zealand government
has committed one million dollars per year over five years for a nationwide EV information and
promotion campaign. Other measures adopted in various jurisdictions include issuing EVs with
distinctive number plates and making EV public charging infrastructure highly visible.

In undertaking this inquiry, it may be prudent for the Committee to also consider the growing
interest and preparation underway for automated vehicles and an automated transport network.
Notwithstanding the many challenges and issues that need to be worked through, recent studies
that suggest an automated and intelligent transport network could lead to shared mobility, with
significantly fewer cars on the road, and improved road safety does suggest an exciting and
more sustainable transport future in Australia if the appropriate planning, safeguards and
incentives are in place. Investment in public transport as a key component of the intelligent
transport network will be critical.

As noted by academics from Monash University and Queensland University of Technology,
`through the convergence of automation, electrification and ride-sharing technologies,
autonomous vehicles could significantly reshape real estate, urban development and city
planning — as the automobile did in the last century.’6 Serious consideration needs to be given
to how our land-use planning and building system can appropriately support and facilitate a
smooth and efficient transition to a transport network that is markedly different to the transport
system we live with today. For example, councils may seek to encourage charging to be off
street where there is excess parking, not on the street which should be prioritised for footpaths,
bike lanes and trees.  some councils do not consider on-street EV
charging appropriate in city centers or see it as the responsibility of local government to facilitate
the refueling of private vehicles.

In May 2018, the MAV State Council resolved that the MAV advocate to the State Government
to request additional investment to expedite the progressive conversion of Victoria’s diesel bus
fleets to well-designed E-buses. Councils place importance on supporting the uptake of E-
buses with highest priority for pedestrian routes and bus routes shared with bicycle paths,
because of:

 adverse health problems for cyclists, pedestrians and passengers exposed to toxic

## diesel fumes;

 costs to the health budget of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases;
 adverse amenity impacts for kerbside trading and outdoor activity;
 policy to maximise active transport and public transport – inconsistent with endemic use

### of outdated, highly toxic diesel emission buses;

Australian cities are lagging behind other international cities in the rollout of electric buses
powered by batteries that are rechargeable with renewable energy. German cities, Paris,
Copenhagen, Madrid, Mexico City, Athens and London have all announced plans to phase out
diesel vehicles from city centres. E-buses are increasingly cost-competitive due to lower
maintenance costs, and electric charging is cheaper than diesel refuelling offering pollution-free,
quieter, cleaner streets. Manufacturing E-buses also has potential to create a new industry and
jobs. Policies and incentives are needed to convert diesel bus fleets across Australia to well-
designed E-buses, with improved services, routing, comfort and features such as Wi-Fi which
are capable of attracting higher patronage levels.

MAV is supporting a workshop - EV Ready Local Government Fleets - on 29 August which is
the first part of a project run by ClimateWorks, the Electric Vehicle Council and the MAV, aimed
at enabling greater electric vehicle uptake in local government fleets. By participating in this
workshop, councils will have the opportunity to participate in a four month program that will help
them to get electric vehicle ready. The programme includes a tool to help councils understand
the emissions and financial impacts of increasing electric vehicle uptake in their fleet; assistance
developing a long-term electric vehicle target for councils and advice on electric vehicle
purchasing and connections to car companies.

Opportunities for EV manufacturing, supply and value chain services in Australia, and related economic benefits

The applicability of EVs in public transport bus fleets and public sector fleets is a good example
of opportunities and policy measures which could benefit the EV manufacturing, supply and
value chain services.

As noted above, many Victorian councils have invested in and/or trialled electric
vehicles for their fleet and have also supported the installation of public charging stations. The
City of Melbourne and the City of Moreland are notable early adopters and leaders in the EV
space, as are Whitehorse City Council and City of Casey. Numerous Victorian councils eagerly
participated in the Victorian Government’s EV trial in 2012-2014.

The lack of suitable lower-cost EV models available for purchase has been a key barrier to
greater uptake of EV in council fleets. We anticipate that as more EV models become available
councils’ willingness to invest in EV will also increase and support manufacturing, supply and
value chain services.

 in seeking council input to this submission it was made clear to the MAV
that rural and regional councils are just as interested and excited by the opportunities that EVs
present as metropolitan councils. As noted above, affordability, availability of charging
infrastructure, vehicle travel range and fit for purpose will be key considerations for councils
considering transitioning their fleet to EV.

It would be remiss for this submission not to note the ground-breaking work that Moreland City
Council is doing to develop a fleet of waste vehicles powered by 100 per cent renewable
hydrogen, the first of its kind in Australia. The 100 per cent renewable hydrogen will be
generated using electrolysis and a mix of storm water harvesting and solar generation, as well
as power purchased from wind farms. Council is partnering with H2U to develop and test a fleet
of prototype trucks which will be built locally. Benefits to residents will include quieter rubbish
collection and better air quality, while carbon emissions and costs for the council will also
decrease.

We understand that bulk purchasing of EVs for government fleet in New Zealand and other
countries has been utilised effectively as a strategy to encourage widespread uptake of EVs and
investment in EV charging infrastructure. With the Victorian Government’s fleet management
centralised through VicFleet, a business unit of the Department of Treasury and Finance, it
seems likely that it would not be too complex to have the same approach applied here in
Victoria. As the minister responsible for the government’s passenger and light commercial
vehicle fleet policy, it will be critical that the Minister for Finance understands the many benefits
of EVs.

There are many trials and research projects underway in other jurisdictions exploring the
feasibility and benefits of EV usage in public transport systems. Potentially helpful case studies

for the Committee include the Zero Emission Urban Bus System (ZEUS) activity in the
European Union and, more locally, the ACT government’s EV bus trials. Councils are very keen
to see the State invest in and support greater uptake of electric buses in our public transport
network.

How federal, state and territory Governments could work together to support EV uptake and manufacturing, supply and value chain
activities

Australia does not have an overarching policy framework to regulate the EV market with all the
States and Territories implementing different policies to encourage the development of the
industry. A coordinated policy response at all levels of government is needed, and should
include local government which will potentially play a key role in supporting EV uptake on a
number of levels as outlined above.

Local Government manages roads, car parks, public lighting and public buildings, which is all
infrastructure that can be used to install and manage EV charging stations. It should also be
considered that EV charging infrastructure may also need to be considered within the context of
utilisation by autonomous vehicles.

## Conclusion

The MAV appreciates the opportunity to register our and Victorian councils’ interest in the
Senate Select Committee’s inquiry.

By adopting a zero net emissions by 2050 target, the Victorian Government has made clear its
commitment to be a leader in climate change action. Noting that transport emissions are a
substantial contributor to Victoria’s overall emissions,  support for and investment
in EVs, including in our government fleet and public transport network, will play a key role in
helping Victoria meet its emissions reduction targets.

Apart from emissions reductions, widespread uptake of EVs in Victoria offers many potential
benefits including improved air quality, reduced noise and amenity impacts, reduced fleet
maintenance costs, and new economic stimulus. Experience overseas shows however that
regulatory and economic incentives are essential to realise the benefits that widespread
uptake of EVs bring.

A new set of policy frameworks are required before rapid advances in transport technologies
open up new possibilities, enabling EV and AV to achieve their potential in terms of emissions
reduction and wider transport efficiency gains. Both the Victorian government and the Australian
government have a critical role to play in this regard.

As road infrastructure providers, fleet managers and representatives of their local communities,
Victorian councils also have a strong interest in supporting a smooth transition to EVs and are
keen to work with other levels of government, and with community and industry to make this
transition happen.

## Recommendations

to assist with a smooth and efficient transition to EVs it is critical that the
Commonwealth and state governments work together with local government, to ensure a
coordinated approach is taken and that the appropriate policies and incentives are in place.

### Specifically we recommend that:

1) The Senate Select Committee advocates for the Commonwealth to :

a. Introduce more stringent light vehicle carbon dioxide emissions standards b. Consider removing or discounting the Luxury Car Tax (LCT) applicable to EVs
c. Consider removing fringe benefits tax for EVs

2) The Senate Select Committee actively supports increased uptake of EVs in government

fleets and public transport fleet including by establishing minimum targets.

3) The Australian Government should give highest priority to promoting and facilitating

through incentives, E-buses as EVs - given most run as a public service, albeit under
contract approvals. Governments should provide leadership in this field.

4) The Senate Select Committee provides regulatory and economic incentives to
achieve a heterogenous, strategically placed network of EV charging points across
Victoria.

5) The Australian Government, the EV industry and electricity providers support the

development, installation and use of clean energy-dependent EV charging infrastructure
wherever possible.

6) The Australian Government support the development of a centralised database or map

of all EV charging points that is clear, easily accessible and kept current.

7) The Australian Government invest in educating the public and promoting the benefits of
